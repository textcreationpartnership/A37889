            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>THis Treatiſe ſo long expected (becauſe ſo long promiſed) is at length made publick, although not without much labour and difficulty in the compoſure, as well by reaſon of the Intricacy of the Subject it ſelf, as the various interruptions in my own Affairs. The Intricacy of the Subject will appear, if we conſider that there are few or no preſidents extant, or to be obtained, of any moment, that treat of this Subject, especially as to the meaſure of time, whereby we ſhould know when the effects will moſt principally manifeſt themſelves; However I doubt not but I have ſufficiently handled the ſubject in all the parts there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, to the ſatisfaction of the Ingenious, or at leaſt to incourage them to make a further diſquiſition; what I have done I dare preſume to ſay is performed from moſt rational principles, not hitherto ſo copiouſly hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led. And indeed it is not this part of Aſtrology alone, but there are others alſo, wherein we finde great deficiency in the Ancients, by reaſon of the inſufficiency of their Aſtronomical Tables; ſo that they were oven forced upon many abſurdities to ſalve up the errours they were fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently ſubject to; and how obſervable is it even in our late Profeſſors al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo (and in ſome now living) that (following the ſteps of the Ancients without due examination, or taking notice of their miſtakes) have been conſtrained to wring and ſcrue accidents to agree to their poſitions of Heaven, whether they have been congruous or proper one to another, or not! and ſo have wreſted their time many minutes, and ſometimes ſome hours from the truth, as I could plainly and ſufficiently inſtance; but I forbear: This I ſay is frequent in ſome, which in Nativities (the moſt neceſſary doctrine in particlar judgements) how great injury it may be to the perſon concerned, the judicious do very well know, and our reaſon may inform us. As to the irruptions, or rather interruptions, that have happened in my own affairs (which hath alſo been one main cauſe of prolonging of time) indeed they have been many and great <hi>(Ratione ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis ad Corp. Saturni &amp; M. C. ad corp. Martis</hi> and other untoward Configurations) But it is the providence of God that (in the language of Dr. <hi>Brown,</hi> in his <hi>Relig. Med.)</hi> hath ſo conſtituted the Configura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Heaven at my Nativity, and I am therewith content, till it be his pleaſure otherwiſe to dispoſe of my fate, which at preſent (I thank
<pb facs="tcp:41577:4"/> God) I am in no wiſe aſhamed to own, ſince, I ſay, it is his providence, who for our tranſgreſſions viſueth at his pleaſure (both in Mercy and Juſtice) to the third and fourth generation. But theſe I ſay, have been one main cauſe that have obſtructed the publiſhing of this Book, which was long ſince intended to be publiſhed; but this is not all, there have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo been many delayes and hinderances ſince it went from my hands, through one occaſion or another; however, for what concerns my ſelf, by reaſon of thoſe enormities I have been ſo abundantly ſubject to, let me be excuſed, if I have been more careful of the ſubſtance and plainneſſe of the matter it ſelf, than the elegancy of Style, or the curioſities of Stops and Pointings, for which I muſt ſubmit to the cenſure of the judicious.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Notable tranſactions have indeed been acted upon the ſtage of the World before the Book came forth (but not before it was penn'd, as di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers of my friends do very well know) but let me tell you, thoſe accidents are not ſo properly the effects of the Conjunction it ſelf, but of ſome con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comitant Configurations preceding, as you may perceive I have mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in its proper place, the ♀ it ſelf not manifeſting its effects ſo ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly to the World, ſo that in that reſpect the Book is come forth time enough; and to what accidents have happened already (as thoſe between <hi>Portugal</hi> and <hi>Spain,</hi> the Pope and the King of <hi>France,</hi> &amp;c.) I dare preſume to affirm without oſtentation, they were timely predicted from the principles and reaſons there mentioned.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Some there are that have objected, that nothing could be predict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from this Conjunction; theſe are ſuch who deny any Influence at all in the Stars, especially as to mundane affairs. But theſe may be convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by their own ſenſe: for there is nothing more apparent, than that the configurations of the Celeſtial Powers, especially of the Superiours, do cauſe various and notable mutations of the Air; that the application of the Moon to the fortunate or malevolent beams of the good or bad pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets, doth cauſe notable &amp; apparent changes and alterations in the bodies of ſick people, over whom ſhe hath an eſpecial influence; that by the Sun's tranſit through the ſeveral parts of Heaven, and his various de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination to the Northward or Southward of the Equinoctial, the ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of the year are not onely divided, but all things that are produced out of the Earth, have their Viciſſitudes, their Generation, Growth, and Corruption; though in different manner, in ſeveral parts of the world, and in different years, which is cauſed by the configurations of the other Planets, either to the Sun, or among themſelves. And who ſhould deny
<pb facs="tcp:41577:4"/> their influences in matters political &amp; civil, as well as in natural, ſure I am many inſtances might be produced to the ſatisfaction of the moſt ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulous; I deſire (with <hi>Bellantius)</hi> onely to have the Nativity of ſuch as are ſo incredulous of the celeſtial powers, that by Arguments taken from the experience of their own affairs, I might convince them, to avoid all other arguments that might be produced ſufficient enough to the purpoſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>But one, and he no m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>an profeſſor (as he thinks himſelf) will make us believe, that little can be known of certainty from the Conjunction; Firſt becauſe that great Conjunctions do happen but once in 794 or 795 years, and there being few or no preſidents ſince the Creation. <hi>Ergo.</hi> Secondly, the Houſe of Heaven cannot be obtained, in which the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction happens, therefore judged impoſſible to know the effects; as if all depended upon the Houſe of Heaven. But to the firſt, I anſwer, this is no ſuch great Conjunction, that happened in the year 1603 (its in the diſcourſe you may ſee at large) and this is the third Conjunction that hath happened in that Trigon, which indeed ſhould have beeen the fourth inorder, &amp;c. But ſuppoſe it had been their firſt Conjunction, we have ſome general rules (though but ſhort) to judge of great Conjunctions; nor are thoſe preſidents we have of ſo little uſe, as to be neglected; but muſt we have preſidents of neceſſity for all we write or judge? then I fear this Aſtrologer will hardly ever be capable of judging a Nativity true while he lives; I have great reaſon to think, and do verily believe he never yet did, or very rarely. As for his poſition of Heaven, I have ſaid as much of that in the Diſcourſe it ſelf as is neceſſary; and certainly there are other things of more principal concernment to judge of, than the Houſe of Heaven, which I need not ſtand to mention here, becauſe ſufficiently handled in the Book it ſelf; and if we conſider the great variety of judgement in reſpect of different Meridians and Elevations of the Pole, who is there will ſatisfie or incourage an Artiſt for the great la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour it will require?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>But why do I trifle time in anſwering one, who with much confidence and as much ignorance doth cavil at the labours of others (nay moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratefully againſt thoſe who have been his greateſt ſupport and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moters) whileſt it may be made evidently appear that in all or moſt that ever he did yet, he hath committed (frequently) moſt groſs and abſurd er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours in his very fundamentals? and this appears not to be want of care or through overſight, but abſolutely for want of judgement; and yet he muſt be a corrector of (or rather a caviller at) other mens labours, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
<pb facs="tcp:41577:5"/> though, as I could make it appear, he underſtands them not; But I ſhall refer my Reader to a particular Treatiſe ſhortly to come forth, wherein this boaſting Ignoramus is anatomized to the full, his Abſurdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, Ignorance, and groſs abuſe of Art particularly laid open and made known to undeceive the world.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>But, to thou that art courteous, this Book is commended to thy judici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous cenſure; the ſubject it ſelf is not able, and I have been carefull to my power to perform what lay on on my part, without playing the Plagiary, or robbing any man of his Labours; nor have I had the aſſiſtance of any, either in Calculations or Judgement; not that I am ambitious of any Igenuity therein, but having uſed an honeſt endeavour in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance thereof; if thou meeteſt with any errours or deficiency, either in the Pen or Preſs, let me crave (as I doubt not of) thy courteous cenſure, and care to correct; And as for the envious, I challenge and expect their emendation, or be ſilent.</hi>

               </argument>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He Cauſes of all Natural Mutations (next unto God) whether as to the World in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, or more particularly as to Humane bodies, are the vertues and influences of the Celeſtial bodies; whereof ſome are ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med <hi>more,</hi> others <hi>leſſe</hi> principal.</p>
               <p>The more principal cauſes (as they are diſtinguiſhed by the Learned) are the tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutations of the <hi>Abſides</hi> or <hi>Aphelions</hi> of the Planets, Great <hi>Conjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions</hi> of the Superiours, new <hi>Stars</hi> and <hi>Comets;</hi> to which ſome have added (though as it is conceived not upon ſufficient grounds) the change of the Sun's excentricity, and the obliquity of the Ecliptique.</p>
               <p>Cauſes leſſe principal, or <hi>adjutant</hi> Cauſes (as <hi>Spineus</hi> termes them) are <hi>Eclipſes</hi> of the Luminaries, Leſſer Conjunctions, An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual Revolutions; to which are ſuppoſed the motion of profe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the great Orb, of great Conjunctions before the Floud, the Birth of <hi>Chriſt, Mahomet,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>All which have their variety of Effects, according to their dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent qualities, and the nature of the ſubject they operate upon;
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:41577:7"/> which (although ſome are ſcrupulous) is confirmed by the inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of the <hi>Almighty</hi> himſelf, <hi>Sint &amp; Signa,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Let them be for ſignes and for ſeaſons;</hi> And indeed, in order to the will and power of the Lord, they are but as ſignes of his providential will and pleaſure; but as to natural Operations, they are not improperly called Cauſes; for <hi>Sub Deo ſemper agunt,</hi> is a true Motto; And not onely this inſtitution of God himſelf, but the conſent of the Learned do alſo confirm it; For S. <hi>Auſtin</hi> the Divine hath this ſaying, <hi>Deus inferiora regit per Superiora,</hi> God governeth all inferiour things by their Superiours: And the Philoſopher, <hi>Cardanus Segm. 2. Aph. 58. Dei igitur altiſſimi coe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum eſt inſtrumentum quo agit, impellit, regitque;</hi> Heaven is the inſtrument of the moſt high God, by which he acteth, inforceth, and governeth all things.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ameſius</hi> in his <hi>Medulla Theologica, lib. 1. cap. 9. de providentia Dei,</hi> terms it <hi>modus ordinarius,</hi> the ordinary and uſual way of Gods providence, wherein we are to conſider both the <hi>antecedent</hi> and the <hi>conſequent,</hi> as it is in <hi>Hoſ. 2. 22. Exaudiam coelos &amp; ipſi exaudient terram,</hi> &amp;c. I will hear the Heavens (ſaith God) and they ſhall hear the Earth, and the Earth ſhall hear the Fruit, and the Corn, and the Oyl, and they ſhall hear <hi>Iſrael.</hi> And this or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der (ſaith he) is that Law of Nature adhibited by God himſelf at the Creation, <hi>Fiat eſto, ſit ita,</hi> Let it be ſo, and it was ſo. Hence the Prophet ſtyles them, the Statutes and Ordinances of the <hi>Sun,</hi> and of the <hi>Moon,</hi> and <hi>Stars, Jer.</hi> 31. 35, 36. ver. and chap. 33. 20. he calls it Gods Covenant with them.

               <p>Hence then we may conclude with <hi>Cardan. Seg. 1. Aphor. 20. Aſtrologia altiſſima ſcientiarum eſt, tum quia de coeleſtibus, tum quia de futuris, quorum ſcientia non ſolum divina eſt, ſed etiam utiliſſima;</hi> of the Sciences, the language or influences of the <hi>Stars</hi> is the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme, becauſe it treateth of celeſtial things, as well as of things to come, the knowledge of which is not onely divine, but alſo profitable; a good reaſon is alſo rendered by Great <hi>Alber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſi ordinationem nulla ſcietia humana perfectè attingit, ficut

               <p>Now ſeeing by the conſent of the moſt learned in this Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, it is not one configuration of the Celeſtial powers alone, <hi>Porrò multa neceſſaria ad hanc inquiſitionem,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Rig.</hi> 53. But there are moreover many things neceſſary to this diſquiſition; as the knowledge of former ſuperiour configurations; the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comitancy of great Eclipſes, and ſuch like, which are to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered in general Events: it is neceſſary therefore that we take ſome conſideration of thoſe forementioned cauſes of Natural Mutations, for the better amplifying the diſcourſe of the preſent ſubject.

               <argument>
                  <p>Of thoſe accidents ſignified by the Mutation of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phelions of the Planets.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>ANd firſt, for the mutation of the Aphelions; That principal tranſactions do attend theſe, take the authority of <hi>Cardanus Segm. 1. Aphor. 37. Per mutationes abſidum regna &amp; Regiones &amp; Religiones mutant.</hi> By the change of the Abſides or Aphelions of the Planets out of one ſign into another, Kingdoms, Regions, Religions, Faith, Sects and Opinions of men, are altered. So <hi>Rigel. Aph.</hi> the 9. and he gives this reaſon; If the Planet, whoſe
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:41577:8"/> 
                  <hi>Abſis</hi> it is, be aſcending in theſe or the oppoſite places, he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts vertue of the nature thereof, which vertue is moſt ſtrong in the <hi>Abſis,</hi> but depraved in the oppoſite place. <hi>Grandes ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent imperus cauſare, &amp; rerum honoribus mutationes, tranſitus augium in diverſa ſigna, &amp; diverſos terminos.</hi> Anonym. 244. The tranſits of the Auges or Aphelions of the Planets in divers ſigns and parts of Heaven, do uſe to cauſe grand mutations in Empires, and in the glory and honour of things. And if I may add my own conjecture or opinion in this point, The Aphelions of the Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets being thoſe parts of their Ellipſes or Orbites, in which when the Planets are, they are at their greateſt diſtance from the Sun, (their proper focus and center of motion) and where they may be said to begin and end their peculiar perids and revolutions, and conſequently their apparent motions are encreaſed or dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed, being meaſured from thence, It therefore ſeems rational to me, that as they are varied from one point or part of Heaven to another, they ſhould cauſe proportional mutations on Earth.</p>
               <p>And if we would know where and in what nature theſe acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents will be, the forementioned propoſition of <hi>Lud. de Regiis</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms us. <hi>Illarum gentium quarum ſignificator erit planeta. augis per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutata;</hi> thoſe mutations will happen among thoſe people, whoſe ſignificator is the Planet whoſe Aphelion is ſo chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Mutatioque erit bonum vel malum, ſecundum naturam ſignificato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum ſuperiorum illorum temporum, &amp; ſecundum naturam ſignificatio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis.</hi> And this mutation ſhall be to good or ill, according to the ſuperiour ſignicator of thoſe times, and the nature of the ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.</p>
               <p>But-ſince this doctrine hitherto hath not been ſufficiently hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led (as indeed no wonder) I muſt here of neceſſity give caution to prevent miſtakes: For indeed, it muſt be Reaſon muſt guide us to the knowledge of the true effects; our Experience in this particular being very deficient, and that for theſe two reaſons eſpecially.</p>
               <p>Firſt, the ſlow motion by which it is varied; which is onely 48 ſeconds in a year, <hi>(ex Tabulis Carolinis</hi> 
                  <note n="*" place="margin">In other Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſes, the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is ſlower in ſome, though ſwifter in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</note>) occaſioned by the preceſſion of the Aequinox, and not from any motion that is in
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:41577:8"/> the Aphelion (as the Author of the Caroline Aſtronomy hath ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diciouſly prov'd) which ſlow motion varies but one ſign in 2250 years; ſo that the Aphelions have not tranſited above two ſigns and a half ſince the creation of the World, (as we generally ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count it) and therefore were there no other reaſon, it were enough, ſince we ſhould have almoſt no examples to verifie this doctrine.</p>
               <p>But another argument may be taken from the unhappy mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtakes of almoſt all <hi>Aſtronomers,</hi> eſpecially the Ancients, whoſe Aſtronomy being founded upon a miſtaken Hypotheſis, might very well be deficient in the motion and places of the <hi>Aphelions;</hi> nor is the difference ſo ſmall among the Moderns, as that we may truſt to any Radix whereon to build any ſolid judgement; for if we believe <hi>Spineus,</hi> the Aphelion of <hi>Saturn</hi> was tranſlated out of <hi>Sagittary</hi> into <hi>Capricorn, Anno</hi> 1630. but by the Tables ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of <hi>Kepler</hi> and <hi>Bullialdus,</hi> that Aphelion is not changed till after the year 1700. almoſt 100 years difference; and by the accurate tables of <hi>Aſtronomia Carolina,</hi> not till the year 1818. neer 100 years after that.</p>
               <p>So likewiſe the Aphelion of Mars by the computation of the Authors aforeſaid, ſhould have entred <hi>Virgo, Anno</hi> 1650. but by the <hi>Caroline Tables</hi> it is not till the year 1691. where, by the way we may note, that what grand alterations or changes have been conjectured by ſome, to be the effects of theſe or ſuch like mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations of the Aphelions, cannot be expected to happen accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly; or if any ſuch accidents ſhould happen neer thoſe times, they muſt be the portents of other cauſes. Theſe things (I ſay) I thought neceſſary to give caution of, not to be critical againſt thoſe Learned Authors, whoſe miſtakes are rather to be pitied than cavill'd at; ſince we are ſo much ingaged to Antiquity for their willing endeavours.</p>
               <p>And becauſe it may be worth our obſervation, let us examine the laſt mutations of the <hi>Aphelions,</hi> that ſo by comparing the Times with Hiſtory, we may ſee what notable tranſactions have happened in the World.</p>
               <p>If we ſubſtract 2250 years from the year of Chriſt 1818. at what time the <hi>Aphelion</hi> of <hi>Saturn</hi> enters <hi>Capricorn</hi> (that is by the <hi>Caroline Tables,</hi> which I rather accept of, becauſe they are more
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:41577:9"/> harmonious and demonſtrative in themſelves, more conſentaneous to all undoubted obſervation; and (though but new) yet more approved of than any other, by the moſt able and learned of our Engliſh Aſtronomers) I ſay, by making ſubſtraction it brings us to the year before Chriſt, 432. when the <hi>Aphelion</hi> of <hi>Saturn</hi> entred <hi>Sagittary.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Aphelion of <hi>Jupiter</hi> is this year 1663. (in the beginning thereof) in 8 deg. 15 min. 36 ſeconds of <hi>Libra,</hi> which is the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or retroceſſion of the Equinox in 619 years, which if we ſubſtract from this year, it brings us back to the year of Chriſt 1044. for its entrance into that ſign. And ſo the <hi>Aphelion</hi> of <hi>Mars</hi> (by the ſame computation) entred <hi>Leo, Anno anto Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtum,</hi> 559.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Apogaeon</hi> of the <hi>Sun</hi> entred <hi>Cancer,</hi> (or rather the <hi>Aphelion</hi> of the Earth <hi>Capricorn)</hi> in the 1156 year of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Aphelion</hi> of <hi>Venus</hi> entred <hi>Aquarius, Anno Chriſti</hi> 1506. and of <hi>Mercury</hi> the 746 of Chriſt into <hi>Sagittary.</hi> 
                  <note n="*" place="margin">Nota.</note> By all which it appears, there is not any mutation of any of the <hi>Aphelions</hi> of the primary Planets, during the effects of our preſent Conjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</p>
               <p>If we would more particularly know the nature of theſe tranſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, from <hi>Saturn</hi> we judge of Antiquities, renovation of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient cuſtomes, of things already begun; of Sects, Schiſmes, He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſies, deſtruction and depopulation of Kingdomes and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treys, all manner of Idolatries, Jeſuitiſm, Monkery, all Jewiſh Superſtitions, ſordid and inhumane debauchery, ruine of Build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and ancient Foundations, Dearth, Famine, Captivities, Shipwracks, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>From <hi>Jupiter</hi> is known the change of ſuch things as chiefly concern the Law, Religion, and the worſhip of God, eſpecially as to Church-diſcipline. He hath ſignification of the Gentry of any Kingdome or Countrey, and particularly of the Clergy and Lawyers.</p>
               <p>From <hi>Mars</hi> is judged Wars, Commotions, Inſurrections, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellions, Maſſacres, Perſecutions, Murthers, all Martial and Military affairs; firing of Houſes and Cities, Rapine, Theft, all manner of Tyranny and Oppreſſion.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Sun</hi> ſignifies new Monarchies, Empires, Kingdomes,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:41577:9"/> which ſhould continue in great Majeſty, glory, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nown.</p>
               <p>By <hi>Venus</hi> we judge of Sports, Games, all manner of Pleaſure and Delight, Voluptuouſneſſe, Adulteries, Fornications, but great peace and plenty of all things, and a general Tranquillity ſhe alſo ſignifies.</p>
               <p>From <hi>Mercury</hi> we know the fate of Arts and Sciences, the diſcoveries of all ingenious Inventions and ſecret Devices; he ſignifies <hi>Philoſophers, Aſtronomers,</hi> and ſuch as are lovers of all curious Arts; alſo Merchants, Arithmetick and Accomp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Apogaeon</hi> of the <hi>Moon</hi> (depending upon another law of motion) is more frequently changed out of one ſign into another, <hi>viz.</hi> in or about nine months. It entred the ſign of <hi>Scorpio</hi> in <hi>June</hi> 1662. about the 18. day (by the <hi>Carol. Tab.)</hi> and it enters <hi>Sagit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary</hi> about the 17 of <hi>March</hi> this year 1663. and into <hi>Capricorn December</hi> following.</p>
               <p>So that by the ſwiftneſſe of this we may indeed have experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence enough; onely we muſt note, that the <hi>Moon</hi> is but the Earths attendant, a ſecondary Planet, and cannot ſignifie any ſuch grand tranſactions to the world as thoſe of the primary Planets; yet let us obſerve what conſiderable Events may happen in thoſe Countreys ſubjrct to the ſign <hi>Sagittary,</hi> during the Tranſit of the <hi>Apogaeon</hi> through the ſign.</p>
               <p>Aſtrologers ſay, that under <hi>Sagittary</hi> are <hi>Spain, Portugal, Hungaria, Dalmatia, Slavonia, Arabia</hi> the Happy, and divers other Southern Countreys, which with the dominions of the other ſigns over their ſeveral Countreys and Regions, are plentifully mentioned in other Books. Thus (I ſay) who pleaſe, may by comparing the Hiſtories of former times, ſee whether ſuch like, or what other notable tranſactions have ſucceded thoſe times, for the better correction of this (hitherto) uncertain Doctrine.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>Of the ſeveral Conjunctions of the Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour Planets.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>BUt there are other <hi>principal cauſes</hi> more certain (if we take them in a general ſenſe, as to time) and thoſe are the ſeveral <hi>Conjunctions</hi> of the ſuperiour Planets, <hi>Saturn</hi> and <hi>Jupiter,</hi> who are the moſt ponderous Planets, and ſlow of motion, and therefore called the Superiours, as well as by reaſon of their remote di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance from the <hi>Sun,</hi> who is their center. And of theſe is the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent ſubject of our diſcourſe in particular, together with a conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of other cauſes in general.</p>
               <p>But of theſe Conjunctions there are three kinds, as by the Learned they have been diſtinguiſhed; and they are <hi>Great, Mean,</hi> and <hi>Leſſer Conjunctions;</hi> and theſe (I ſay) are to be underſtood of the two ſuperiours themſelves, not of thoſe Leſſer Conjuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of <hi>Saturn</hi> and <hi>Jupiter</hi> with <hi>Mars;</hi> of which more by and by.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Greateſt</hi> or <hi>Great</hi> Conjunctions are thoſe after a full period and revolution of the whole Circle, <hi>viz.</hi> when Saturn and Jupiter have made their ſeveral conjunctions in the ſeveral triplicities, and do again begin to conjoyn in the <hi>firſt triplicity</hi> (which is alſo called the <hi>Fiery</hi> and <hi>Regal Triangularity)</hi> and this is a period of 794 years and ſome odd dayes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Mean Conjunctions</hi> are thoſe which are made, or do happen after the leaving of one, and conjoyning in another ſubſequent Triplicity, as from <hi>Aries, Leo, Sagittary,</hi> which is the firſt; into <hi>Taurus, Virgo,</hi> or <hi>Capricorn,</hi> which is the ſecond; and ſo ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſively into <hi>Gemini, Libra, Aquarius,</hi> which is the third; and laſtly into <hi>Cancer, Scorpio,</hi> and <hi>Piſces,</hi> which is the fourth and laſt <hi>Triplicity</hi> or <hi>Triangularity.</hi> And this is a period of neer 200 yeares, or more particularly in 199 yeares and ſome odde dayes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Leſſer,</hi> or the <hi>leaſt Conjunctions</hi> of Saturn and Jupiter, are thoſe which happen (after the entring of any one Triplicity) in ſigns
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:41577:10"/> of the ſame Triplicity, and theſe do happen once in or about 20 years; ſo that by making ten Conjunctions in one and the ſame Triangularity, it doth appear they are neer 200 years ere they remove out of one, and enter by conjunction into another Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity; and conſequently neer 800 years ere they perform theſe conjunctional Revolutions of the <hi>four Triplicities</hi> of the whole Circle.</p>
               <p>And here note, that the true diſtance of any of theſe (whether <hi>Great, Mean,</hi> or <hi>Leſſer)</hi> Conjunctions, cannot be obtained with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out careful calculation, and that from the beſt Theories (by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the great diſcrepancy among themſelves, as hereafter will appear.) For if we take the diſtances of time between one Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction and another, ſince their laſt return into the <hi>Fiery Trigon,</hi> the variety will appear too great to be confided in, whereby any certain rule can be made without calculation: For, from the 7. of <hi>December Anno</hi> 1603. the time of the firſt, to the 7. of <hi>July Anno</hi> 1623. the time of the ſecond, are 19 years 212 dayes, and from thence to the 16. of <hi>Feb.</hi> 1642/3. the time of the third Conjunction, are 19 years 224 dayes; thence to the year 1663. <hi>October</hi> the 10. the time of a fourth Conjunction (and that which is now the principal ſubject here intended) is 20 years 236 dayes; and from thence to the next Conjunction in <hi>October Anno</hi> 1682. but 19 years juſt; yet there are two more Conjuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons not long after in the ſame ſign, the one in <hi>January</hi> following; (which is a retrograde Conjunction) the other in <hi>May, Anno</hi> 1683. (a moſt wonderful congreſſion) of which I have nothing to ſay here.</p>
               <p>If you would have the Authority of the Learned, for the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral diſtinctions before mentioned; I muſt refer you to Mr. <hi>Lil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly's Prophetical Merlin,</hi> where this particular is principally handled, from the Precepts of <hi>Cardanus, Naibod, Origanus,</hi> and divers others; I ſhall onely from him quote you the authority of one, and that is <hi>Avendris,</hi> pag. 56. Merl. Proph. <hi>Conjunctio autem magna Jovis oſt cum Saturno, in ſigno Arietis, quod eſt, quia ſunt ſtellae graves, &amp; tardae, &amp; non ſignificant ſuper particularia, imo ſuper communia: &amp; quia ſignum Arietis eſt ſignum primum inter ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na, ergo haec conjunctio vocatur magna, ſed quando vadunt à Triplicita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te ad triplicitatem, tunc vocatur media, conjunctio verò ipſorum de 20

               </p>
               <p>This is the ſame in effect with what was before premiſed, one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Author calls that onely a <hi>Great Conjunction,</hi> which happens in the Sign <hi>Aries,</hi> which is the Firſt Sign of the <hi>Zodiack,</hi> and of the <hi>Fiery</hi> and <hi>Regal Triplicity.</hi> And indeed, all the Maſters of this <hi>Science</hi> do agree in this (as you may ſee in the foremen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned diſcourſe of Mr. <hi>Lilly's) viz.</hi> That thoſe Conjunctions onely are called <hi>Great,</hi> which are firſt made in the <hi>Fiery Triplicity,</hi> and eſpecially in <hi>Aries;</hi> which Conjunction, if at any time it ſhould happen to be (as Mr. <hi>Lilly</hi> there terms it) might properly be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Maxima,</hi> or the <hi>Greateſt Conjunction;</hi> for, not onely is that Sign the firſt of the <hi>Zodiack,</hi> as was ſaid but now, but alſo the vertues ſignified, or operating from ſuch a Conjunction, muſt needs be more univerſal, by reaſon it happens ſo neer the <hi>Equa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor,</hi> whileſt thoſe that happen in <hi>Leo</hi> have more reſpect to the North; thoſe in <hi>Sagittary</hi> to the Southern parts of the World; becauſe their declination is ſuch from the ſaid <hi>Equator.</hi>

               <p>But all the Conjunctions of theſe Planets, at their entrance in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the <hi>Fiery Trigon,</hi> ſince the Creation of the World, have been in <hi>Sagittary,</hi> as by calculation will appear, and as I ſhall afterwards manifeſt, and never any in <hi>Aries.</hi> What the will of the <hi>Almighty</hi> herein is, we may not inquire; but certainly there is ſome <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>canum</hi> therein.

               <p>Many Authors more might be quoted for the verification hereof, but let theſe ſuffice, and let us examine preceding times, and ſee what accidents have ſucceeded thoſe grand Revolutions of the Superiours.</p>
               <p>The firſt Conjunction of theſe Planets in the <hi>Fiery Triplicity</hi> was <hi>Anno Ante Chriſtum,</hi> or before <hi>Chriſt</hi> 3958. but of the Juli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an period 755. in the beginning of <hi>February (Stilo Jul.)</hi> in the 8th. deg. of this very Sign <hi>Sagittary.</hi> This was not many years after the Creation of the World, as it is moſt generally recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.</p>
               <p>The ſecond was in the year of the Julian Period 1549. and 3164 years before Chriſt, in the beginning of <hi>November,</hi> that is 794 years 8 moneths diſtance. And this reſtitution was in the 5. degree of the ſame Sign <hi>Sagittary,</hi> and happened, without doubt, in the dayes of <hi>Enoch</hi> and <hi>Methuſelah.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The third Entrance, (but ſecond Reſtitution of this <hi>Trigon)</hi> was <hi>Anno J. P.</hi> 2343. 2370 years before Chriſt, about the latter end of <hi>Decemb.</hi> in the 8. degree of <hi>Sagittary:</hi> The diſtance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween theſe two returns is 794 years, and almoſt two moneths. The Univerſal <hi>Deluge,</hi> or <hi>Noah's Flood,</hi> happened not many years after this Reſtitution; for certain it was during the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction of the Superiours in the Fiery (or Firſt) <hi>Triplicity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anno</hi> 1575 before Chriſt, but of the Julian Period 3138. there happened three Conjunctions in this <hi>Trigon.</hi> The firſt was about the 12 of <hi>March,</hi> in 9 degr. of <hi>Sagittary;</hi> the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:41577:12"/> was a retrograde Conjunction, and happened about the 20. of <hi>May,</hi> in the 8 degree of <hi>Sagittary;</hi> and the third and laſt was about the 26 of <hi>September,</hi> in 4 degr. of the ſame Sign.</p>
               <p>The fourth Return, but the fifth time they entred this <hi>Trigon</hi> was 781 years before Chriſt, of the Julian Period 3932. about the beginning of <hi>December,</hi> in the 13 degree of <hi>Sagittary.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The fifth Reſtitution was <hi>Anno Chriſti</hi> 15. about the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of <hi>December</hi> alſo, in the 12 degree of the ſame Sign.</p>
               <p>The ſixth was in 809 year of Chriſt, about the 20 of <hi>Octob.</hi> in the 6 deg. of <hi>Sagittary.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The ſeventh and the laſt Return was in the year 1603. <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cember</hi> the 7. in the 8 degree of <hi>Sagittary.</hi> And this is that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der whoſe influence we now are; which being conſidered by <hi>Leotitius</hi> ſome years before, cauſed him to ſay, <hi>Cum ergo nunc no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vus Trigonus, impendeat qui igneus eſt, &amp;c.</hi> Seeing now therefore there is a new <hi>Trigon</hi> at hand, which is the <hi>Fiery,</hi> without doubt new Ages will follow, which will produce raſh and violent Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations in the World.</p>
               <p>There were many eminent Mutations (ſaith Mr. <hi>Lilly)</hi> over all <hi>Europe</hi> in this change of the Planets into the beginning of the <hi>Fiery Triplicity;</hi> We are now in this <hi>Age</hi> (and ſo muſt ſome Ages ſucceeding be) under the dominion hereof, and therefore it is no wonder to ſee and hear every moment of ſo great alterati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in the Kingdomes and Common-wealths of <hi>Europe;</hi> Ever and anon we muſt expect ſuch ſudden change, in theſe our times, as no Age can parallel; and theſe ſharp and bitter contentions are aſſuredly to have their beginning from Religious pretences, or breach of Cuſtomes. Thus he; which how true and judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſly ſpoken, out preſent experience, and certainly future times will abundantly manifeſt.</p>
               <p>What the various accidents have been that have ſucceeded theſe Revolutions of the Superiours, let ſuch as are furniſhed with <note place="margin">Nota.</note> Hiſtory inquire. Yet it muſt not be expected that ſuch great al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terations ſhould immediately ſucceed, but ſometimes ſooner, and ſometimes later, according to the will of the Creator, and the intentions and remiſſions of other Natural Cauſes. For, <hi>Corpora coeleſtia non agunt in inſtanti, ſed cum tempore,</hi> the Coeleſtial
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:41577:12"/> bodies do not act in an inſtant, or not alwayes on a ſudden, but many times at length, and with ſome delay; there muſt be <hi>Coi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> and <hi>Conception,</hi> before there can be a birth or bringing forth of things.</p>
               <p>If we add to either of the forementioned Revolutions 200 (or more truly, 199) years, it brings us to the entrance of the ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour <hi>Planets</hi> into the next <hi>Triplicity,</hi> which are called <hi>Conjunctiones Mediae,</hi> their Mean Conjunctions, for notable tranſactions have ſucceded theſe alſo <hi>(Anonim.</hi> 85.) <hi>Mutationes Trigonum ab uno ſigno ad alterum, vehementes &amp; durabiles mutationes efficient in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinciis &amp; gentibus;</hi> The Mutations of the Triplicities from one Sign to another, do effect vehement and durable mutations in Provinces and Countreys.</p>
               <p>For example. The laſt Reſtitution of the <hi>Fiery Triplicity</hi> (ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept this we are now under) was <hi>Anno Chriſti</hi> 809. (as was mentioned before) about the 20 of <hi>October:</hi> to which if we add 199 years, it brings us to the year 1008. in which year, about the middle of <hi>June, Saturn</hi> and <hi>Jupiter</hi> made their firſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction in the next (which is called the <hi>Earthly) Triplicity,</hi> and that about the 10. or 11. of <hi>Virgo (ex Tab. Carol.)</hi> the Invaſion of <note place="margin">☜</note> 
                  <hi>William</hi> the <hi>Conquerour</hi> was during the effects of this <hi>Trigon,</hi> and ſucceeded about 60 years after.</p>
               <p>And thus the ſame proportion of years being added, we are directed to the third and fourth <hi>Triplicities;</hi> and ſo to the Leſſer Conjunctions, which do happen in ſigns of the ſame <hi>Triplicity,</hi> and are once in 20 years; the particular times of which, for the reaſons already mentioned, are not to be obtained without cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation, <hi>Vid. Proph. Merl. p. 52. &amp; Seq.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As to the quality of the Events, according to the precepts of Aſtrologers, beſides what hath been already mentioned, ſhall be more fully handled in the following diſcourſe, and perhaps may hereafter be inlarged.</p>
               <p>I have been the more large upon theſe things, becauſe they have principal relation to the preſent ſubject; nor is this doctrine of Conjunctions hitherto ſufficiently handled; the beſt Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe I have hitherto met withall (in general) is that foremention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of Mr. <hi>Lilly, viz. Prophetical Merl.</hi> from which I have received great light, to the diſcovery of the effects depending on this Conjunction I am now to treat of.</p>

                  <p>Of Comets and new Starrs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to be conſidered in generall Accidents.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>THere are alſo other principal Cauſes of natural Mutations (as was mentioned in the beginning) and they are <hi>Comets, New Stars, Parahelii,</hi> and <hi>Paraſelenes,</hi> or <hi>Mock-ſuns</hi> and <hi>Mock-moons,</hi> and divers other Meteorological Appearances, which by the Learned we are alſo adviſed to conſider in future Events, <hi>Ptol.

In conſideratione ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neralium eventuum, &amp;c.</hi> In conſideration of general events, <hi>Comets</hi> and all ſuch things as are incident thereto, are to be conſider'd. For (by the 99. of the <hi>Centiloq. Ptol.)</hi> they alſo carry a ſecond part in judgement.</p>
               <p>Hiſtory makes plentiful mention of theſe, and the notable events that have ſucceeded, and our own experience of late years are a ſufficient teſtimony; not to mention many, how ominous was that Comet or Blaſting Star that appeared in the year 1618. to <hi>Germany</hi> eſpecially, and divers other Countreys, too freſh in our memories to be denied? What ſtrange alterations ſucceeded ſuddenly after the Comet of the year 1652. here in <hi>England,</hi> (aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted with other cauſes concomitant, as the Eclipſe of the Sun, &amp;c.) New Lords, New Laws, New Governors and Government, New Cuſtomes, (and what not?) But of this Comet I ſhall have occaſion to ſpeak more in the ſequel.</p>
               <p>Nor can it be with good reaſon conceived, that ſuch Prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies as theſe ſhould appear in vain: <hi>Signa quae videntur in coelo aut Luna vel cum aliis ſtellis, quae apparuerint extra motum &amp; curſum na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tura, nunquam evenient ſine magna mutatione regnorum illius climatis in quo apparuerint.</hi> Rig. Prop. 87.</p>
               <p>Signs which are ſeen in Heaven, either with the Moon, or with other Stars, when they appear beyond the motion and courſe of Nature, they never happen but they portend great mutation of thoſe Kingdomes, or the Kingdomes of that Climate in which they appear.</p>
               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:41577:13"/>
               <p>And here I cannot omit the repetition of thoſe excellent ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions of <hi>Herodotus,</hi> mentioned by Mr. <hi>Lilly, When God intends to puniſh a Nation or a City, he firſt ſignifies his will by Prodigies; Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitur cum hominibus non modo lingua humana, &amp;c. God doth not ſpeak to man with humane tongue onely, As by Prophets, Apoſtles and Paſtors, but alſo by divers forms and Images compoſed in the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And indeed it is worthy of note, that ſeeing thoſe ordinary and more frequent ſignatures of the will of the <hi>Almighty</hi> (the Influen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the Celeſtial Bodies inſtituted by God himſelf at the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>Gen.</hi> 1. 14.) are not ſo diligently obſerved by all, nay deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by ſome, he therefore many times ſends us ſuch prodigious and unaccuſtomed Appearances, ſuch extraordinary and irregu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Accidents in Nature, that he might thereby leave a more deep impreſſion of his <hi>Almighty power</hi> and <hi>Will</hi> in the hearts of the ſons of men, that all might be left without excuſe.</p>
               <p>Not that hereby we limit the more ſecret purpoſes of <hi>God</hi> in the ordering and governing his <hi>Church,</hi> for whoſe glory and promulgation all <hi>Monarchies</hi> and <hi>States</hi> have their being here. But that we may obſerve that God ſeldome bringeth any extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary tranſactions to paſs in this world; but he firſt fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhewes his <hi>Will</hi> and future purpoſe by ſome (ordinary or extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary) productions of Nature.

               <argument>
                  <p>Of Eclipſes, and Leſſer Conjunctions of the Planets.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>HItherto of the moſt principal cauſes of ſuch accidents as do naturally happen in the World; Leſſe principal cauſes are <hi>Eclipſes;</hi> leſſer conjunctions of the Planets, <hi>Revolutions, &amp;c.</hi> And by leſſer conjunctions of the Planets, I mean of <hi>Saturn,</hi> or <hi>Jupiter,</hi> or <hi>Sol,</hi> with <hi>Mars,</hi> which I term <hi>leſſer Conjunctions</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paratively to thoſe of <hi>Saturn</hi> and <hi>Jupiter</hi> alone. And in this ſenſe may <hi>Meſſahala</hi> be underſtood, when he terms the conjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of <hi>Saturn</hi> and <hi>Jupiter Great,</hi> of <hi>Saturn</hi> and <hi>Mars, Mean,</hi> of <hi>Jupiter</hi> and <hi>Mars, the Leaſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe, although they produce many times very forcible effects, yet thoſe effects are not ſo univerſal (eſpecially of Eclipſes, becauſe they variouſly appear in different places, and the defect is ſooner varied) but do operate therefore more eſpecially upon ſome particular places and perſons; which although it be ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times with a malignant kind of violence, yet is the duration thereof of far ſhorter continuance.</p>
               <p>Rightly therefore was it ſaid of <hi>Cardanus, Segm. 7. Aphor. 121. Nulla Eclipſis omnino toti orbi penuriam, aut peſtem pronunciare po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt. Peſtis autem ex his, quatuor annis durare nunquam poteſt.</hi> No Eclipſe can ſignife Want or Scarcity, Peſtilence, or ſuch like Accidents, to be general to the whole World, becauſe thoſe Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents ſignified by Eclipſes cannot laſt above four years.</p>
               <p>Nor do the effects of <hi>Saturn</hi> or <hi>Jupiter</hi> with <hi>Mars,</hi> or of <hi>Sol</hi> with either, continue above two years, becauſe once in or about two years they make conjunction, and thoſe in different parts of Heaven: but the conjunctions of <hi>Saturn</hi> and <hi>Jupiter</hi> do happen but once in twenty years, and that in ſignes of the ſame Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity.</p>
               <p>Theſe therefore are properly ſaid to diſpoſe of the times in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, and thoſe leſſer Cauſes do more particularly ſhew the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention and remiſſion of the effects; For it is an <hi>Axiom, That by
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:41577:14"/> how much a Planet is more ponderous and ſlow of motion, the more pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erfully doth he leave an impreſſion of his influence.</hi> This is very evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent in the <hi>Tranſits</hi> and <hi>Aſpects</hi> of the Planets by the Hylegiacal places of <hi>Nativities,</hi> and in the mutation of the <hi>Air,</hi> and as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrative in other Aſtrological Judgements.</p>
               <p>And theſe therefore are alſo to be conſidered in general judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. For (as hath been already mentioned) it is not onely the Conjunctions themſelves, or any one Configuration that doth operate alone, but the concomitancy of ſuccedent (yea and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent) cauſes that are alſo to be conſidered; according to that notable ſaying of <hi>Naibod, ſup. Alcabit. pag. 357. Tempora vero magnoru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> eventuum non à Saturm &amp; Jovis conjunctionibus ſolummodo, ſed etiam à deliquiis eſſe ſupputanda,</hi> &amp;c. The times of Great Events are not onely ſignified from the conjunction of <hi>Saturn</hi> and <hi>Jupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> but alſo from <hi>Eclipſes;</hi> or from hence it may be inferred, that their Effects (that is of the Superiours) are portended to longer times, by reaſon of the many and infinite Tranſits of themſelves and other Planets through the ſeveral Regions of Heaven, therefore it is neceſſary their influence ſhould oft-times vary and change; but the effects of Eclipſes do ſeldome exceed two years and a half.</p>
               <p>Nay it is the judgement of <hi>Daſipodius, Propoſ. 65. Conjunctio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes magnae niſi ab Eclipſibus vim recipiant non ſunt magni faciendae;</hi> That great Conjunctions are not of ſo great force, or to be ſo much eſteemed of, except they receive ſtrength from Eclipſes, (that is, as to the particular times of the events) although as to generals they have great ſignification: For by the 61. and 62. <hi>Propoſitions, Judicia temporum in magnis eventibus ex Eclipſibus ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muntur.</hi> The Judgements of the times when great Events ſhall happen, are aſſumed from <hi>Eclipſes; Ex Eclipſibus magni effectus proveniunt;</hi> For from <hi>Eclipſes</hi> great Events do happen.</p>
               <p>Thus I ſay are theſe conſiderations to be underſtood; that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the General Accidents of the World are produced from the more ſuperiour cauſes, who have a more general and univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal ſignification; yet then ſhall thoſe accidents moſt evidently appear, when they are put forward by inferiour cauſes, ſuch as are <hi>Eclipſes,</hi> Leſſer conjunctions of the Planets, &amp;c. who never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſſe produce many times very notable effects of themſelves,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:41577:15"/> which yet are ſubordiate to the general diſpoſition of the times.</p>
               <p>Annual Revolutions alſo are to be noted, which ſtrictly ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, cannot indeed be ſaid to be cauſes of Natural Events, but rather as onely ſignes of what accidents ſhall happen in ſuch or ſuch a year, to thoſe Countreys and places for which the Revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution is ſet, according as it hath relation to the then predomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant Configurations (I mean of preceding cauſes) of Heaven.</p>
               <p>Thus <hi>Bonatus</hi> doth plainly inform us: <hi>Fol. (mihi) 224. Per revolutionem Annorum mundi, ſcitur quid in illo Anno ſit futurum de bono aut malo, utrum tranquillus aut guerrae, &amp;c.</hi> By the Revoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the years of the World, is known what will enſue in that year, whether Good or Ill, Peace or War, Plenty or Scarcity, what the condition of <hi>Kings, Princes, Nobles,</hi> the <hi>Religious,</hi> and all other ſorts and degrees of men, and quality of things whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, according to the property of man therein, of the dearneſſe and cheapneſſe of things, of the fruits of the <hi>Earth,</hi> &amp;c. But this being not ſo pertinent to our preſent purpoſe, I omit further diſcourſe thereof.</p>
               <p>Nor is it my task to handle the whole doctrine of General Judgements; who pleaſe may be further ſatisfied as to Effects of Great Conjunctions in general, from that judicious Treatiſe of Mr. <hi>Lilly</hi>'s mentioned already; of the doctrine of <hi>Eclipſes</hi> I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer to his <hi>Annus Tenebroſus;</hi> of <hi>Co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="2 letters">

               <p>As for thoſe other Inventions of the <hi>Ancients,</hi> as the change of the <hi>Excentricity, Profections,</hi> &amp;c. ſince they are not grounded up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſufficient demonſtrative principles of Natural Motions, I have no more to ſay of them, onely, That as divers acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents have happened contrary to expectation, others not accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to prediction, as well in this as in other parts of <hi>Astrology,</hi> did the <hi>Ancients</hi> invent (or conceive there were) other grounds of Judgement, which indeed do ſcarcely deſerve the name of Natural Cauſes.</p>
               <p>Theſe General conſiderations I thought neceſſary to premiſe, as conducing much to our preſent purpoſe.

                  <p>The Conjunction of Saturn and Jupiter 1663. <hi>Octob.</hi> 10. Aſtrologically handled.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>FOr ſuch as are not acquainted with <hi>Aſtrology</hi> and its prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, I think neceſſary to premiſe, That the twelve Signs of the <hi>Zodiack,</hi> are by the Ancients divided into four <hi>Triangularities</hi> or <hi>Triplicities.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The firſt, which they term the <hi>Fiery Triplicity,</hi> is of <hi>Aries, Leo, Sagittarius;</hi> which they alſo ſay is Cholerick, Maſculine, and the Regal Triplicity, and doth therefore ſignifie the moſt princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal accidents of the World.</p>
               <p>The ſecond is of <hi>Taurus, Virgo, Capricorn;</hi> this is called the <hi>Earthly Triplicity,</hi> Melancholy, Feminine, and ſignifie more ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did and vulgar accidents.</p>
               <p>The third <hi>Triplicity</hi> is of <hi>Gemini, Libra, Aquarius;</hi> is Maſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line, Sanguine, Temperate, beholds the firſt by benevolent Aſpect; and do alſo ſignifie very eminent Tranſactions to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue, when conjunctions are made therein.</p>
               <p>The fourth and laſt is <hi>Cancer, Scorpio, Piſces,</hi> Watry, Flegma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick, Cold and Moiſt, inimical to the firſt Triplicity. The ſeveral Conjunctions of theſe ſuperiour Planets, <hi>Saturn</hi> and <hi>Jupiter</hi> (as hath been ſaid) in theſe <hi>Triplicites,</hi> are ſuch as have the moſt prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal ſignification of the affairs of the whole They con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyn but once in 20 years, making 10 conjunctions in ſigns of the ſame Triplicity, and then in order they enter the next.</p>
               <p>This Conjunction I am now to treat of, happens in the firſt of theſe, which becauſe it is the moſt eminent, moſt principal Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects (in their proper times and places) will enſue: What they are more hereafter.</p>
               <pb n="20" facs="tcp:41577:16"/>
               <p>The day on which this Conjunction happens, is the 10 of <hi>October</hi> (by the beſt Tables, or about the 11) as moſt have it. By the <hi>Caroline Tables</hi> (the beſt extant) it ſhould be about 20 min. paſt 9 in the morn.</p>
               <p>By the <hi>Rudolphine Tables,</hi> 37 min. paſt 2 in the morn.</p>
               <p>By <hi>Aſtronomia Inſtaurata,</hi> about 24 min. paſt noon; but by another new Theory of the ſame Authors, not till 24 min. paſt 2 after noon.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argoll</hi> will have it about 8 of the clock the 12 day, a great mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake.</p>
               <p>But ſuch is the difficulty of finding the true moment of any of theſe Conjunctions, by the moſt exact Tables that are, or can be framed by the Art or Induſtry of Man, by reaſon of the ſlow motion of the Superiours.</p>
               <p>It was therefore truly ſaid of <hi>Cardane, Segm. 4. Aphor. 79. Nullius planetae cum altero praeterquam cum Luna, exacta conjunctio, ut per ſeipſum ſignum aſcendens ſciri queat, haberi poteſt.</hi> The exact conjunction of no Planet with another, except the Moon, as that the Sign aſcending may be known, cannot be obtained. Nay ſuch is the diſadvantage (ſaith he) <hi>Nullus mortaliu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> nec inſtrumento nec aliter diſcernere poteſt, in Ptol. fol.</hi> 215. no mortal man, neither with inſtrument nor otherwiſe can diſcern it. <hi>Humanus intellectus non comprehendat,</hi> ſaith <hi>Naibod.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The reaſons I have more fully explained in my Treatiſe of the conjunction of <hi>Saturn</hi> &amp; <hi>Mars, An.</hi> 1658. And therefore, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the rule there preſcribed (which is to take the next ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent new or full Moon, or preceding, eſpecially if it be a new Moon) I have taken the new Moon following, which I the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther accept, becauſe it is almoſt the ſame with the Revolutional Figure for this year, in which the Conjunction happens, which in ſome ſenſe we are adviſed by <hi>Ptolomy</hi> and others to conſider. For the Aſcend. of that Revolution is the 23 deg. of <hi>Leo,</hi> of this the 10 of the ſame Sign.</p>
               <p>Which Lunation, according to the <hi>Carol. Tables,</hi> is as follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, and it were to be wiſhed, that ſuch as are furniſhed with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient Inſtruments, would carefully obſerve ſome dayes before and after (if the weather will permit) that ſo we may have a foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of further ſpeculations.</p>

               <p>This is the Conjunction we are now to handle; it happeneth to be the third Conjunction, ſince their laſt entrance into this Triplicity; the firſt being in the year 1603. <hi>December</hi> the 7. carefully obſerved by Sir <hi>Chriſtopher Heydon</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> and by <hi>Kepler</hi> at <hi>Prague;</hi> between whoſe obſervations was very little difference (the difference of Meridians conſidered) as any may more fully ſee in his defence of <hi>Aſtrology.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This their Inition or entrance into the Fiery Triplicity, is the ſeventh Reſtitution, after their firſt conjunction therein ſince the Creation of the World; Andcertainly (as Mr. <hi>Lilly</hi> well expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth it) hath a more ſecret myſtery of <hi>Sabbatiſm</hi> in it than any other, and promiſeth ſomething of more ſingular moment to
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:41577:17"/> the World; where by the way, I cannot omit a judicious ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of Mr. <hi>Whartons</hi> in his <hi>Hemereſcopeion</hi> for the year 1653.</p>
               <p>It is good reaſon (ſaith he) like as <hi>Rome</hi> was built ſoon after the beginning of the fifth <hi>Fiery Trigon,</hi> (the firſt being that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der which the World was created) and afterwards by little and little increaſed, and amongſt other Cities the great aſſembly of the Inhabitants, People, and Kingdomes ſhe had ſubdued; bore up her head, until at length about the ſixth Fiery Trigon, ſhe had reduced very many Kingdomes of <hi>Europe, Aſia,</hi> and <hi>Africa,</hi> to the form of a Monarchy and ſoveraign Empire, and flouriſhed in great glory. And that from thence this Empire being divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded into two, (Eaſt and Weſt) was obſerved to have fallen to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cay, being troubled with inteſtine Wars, and exhauſted by Alie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations of Kingdomes and Provinces, untill about the ſeventh <hi>Trigon</hi> it was reſtored by <hi>Charls the Great,</hi> and in ſome ſort received its priſtine beauty; ſo ſhall this Empire at this time al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo (during the effects of this eighth <hi>Fiery Trigon)</hi> ſuſtain great mutations. Thus he.</p>
               <p>And ſurely with good reaſon it may be ſo conjectured; it is the judgement of <hi>Alſtedius,</hi> that the Fire of this Conjunction (that is of this Reſtitution of the <hi>Fiery Trigon)</hi> will conſume all the dregs and refuſe of the City of <hi>Rome.</hi> I ſay, there will no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Accidents happen to the <hi>Roman Empire,</hi> during the Effects of this Return of the Superiours into the <hi>Fiery Triplicity;</hi> and thoſe tranſactions will alſo in abundant meaſure be manifeſted, theſe next 20 years; eſpecially about the years 1665. or 66. (as many conjecture) yet do I not conceive that <hi>Rome</hi> it ſelf will be ſubject to ſuch grand Mutations, as ſome have conceived, till the year 1683. or after; in which there happens three Conjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of <hi>Saturn</hi> and <hi>Jupiter</hi> in <hi>Leo,</hi> the Aſcendant of <hi>Rome,</hi> which undoubtedly will have great force thereon, though I cannot ſay to its ſubverſion totally. However, before theſe Superiours have performed their period in this Triplicity (which will be about the year 1801.) there will aſſuredly be very great altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, if not a finall <hi>Cataſtrophe</hi> of the Soveraignty and Dominion thereof; For if (as <hi>Daſipod</hi> ſaith, <hi>Aphor.</hi> 77.) the <hi>Fiery Trigon</hi> hath dominion over the <hi>Chriſtians;</hi> then muſt the <hi>See</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi>
                  <pb n="23" facs="tcp:41577:17"/> be much concerned herein: And beſides, from the poſition of <hi>Mars</hi> in <hi>Leo</hi> at the time of the Conjunction, and ſome other con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations, we ſhall ſpeedily hear of ſome grand Commotions, Wars, Fires, Tumults, and Uproars, &amp;c. that will afflict both City and Countrey in great meaſure.</p>
               <p>King <hi>James,</hi> upon this firſt Entrance of <hi>Saturn</hi> and <hi>Jupiter</hi> into the <hi>Fiery Trigon,</hi> was eſtabliſhed into the Engliſh Monarchy; and in the year 1623. was their ſecond meeting in the ſame Triplicity, <hi>viz.</hi> in <hi>Leo;</hi> not long after was the death of that Glorious Prince, and King <hi>Charls the Firſt</hi> (of happy Memory) was crow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned King as rightful Succeſſor. But behold in the year 1642/3. when according to the accuſtomed order of the Celeſtial Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and the natural courſe of thoſe Superiours, it was to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected they ſhould have their Conjunction in <hi>Aries,</hi> a Sign of the ſame <hi>Triplicity;</hi> contrary (I ſay) to that orderly Method they uſually obſerve, they made conjunction in <hi>Piſces</hi> a Sign of the <hi>Watry Triplicity,</hi> and ſo of quite contrary nature to the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer.</p>
               <p>Excellently was it obſerved therefore of <hi>Campanella,</hi> in his <hi>Aſtrologia, ſub quarto Trigono, qui primum reſpicit hoſtili radio, Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchia prima frangitur, incipium haereſes dirae, armiſque protectae, ob Martem &amp; Lunam, fides plus armis quam miraculis ampliatur, &amp;c.</hi> Under the fourth <hi>Triplicity,</hi> which reſpects the firſt by hoſtile A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, the firſt Monarchy (that is, the Monarchy or Monarchies that ariſe from the firſt <hi>Trigon)</hi> ſhall be broken, direful hereſies begin, protected with <hi>Arms,</hi> by reaſon of <hi>Mars</hi> and the <hi>Moon;</hi> Faith more inlarged by the Sword than Miracle; new Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Tenents ariſe, checking the former Auſterity, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Superſtition: and all this to a good intent, becauſe it is the properties of the Stars to incline.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Conjunctiones in Signis Aqueis, quia eſt Trigonus Martis, ſignificant multa bella; inventiones operum mechanicorum propter martem, haere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes graves &amp; magnos, &amp;c. Daſipod. Aph.</hi> 66. When Conjunctions happen in watry Signes, which is the <hi>Triplicity</hi> of <hi>Mars,</hi> they ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie <hi>Wars,</hi> and the invention of mechanick Works and Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments for that purpoſe; great and grievous Hereſies do alſo abound; the Law and Religion of <hi>Mahomet</hi> had its beginning from this <hi>Triplicity;</hi> to which agrees <hi>Cardan, Spineus,</hi> and others.</p>
               <pb n="24" facs="tcp:41577:18"/>
               <p>And if ſuch accidents do attend the orderly courſe of the Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riours in this <hi>Triplicity,</hi> how much more when it happens ſo irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularly, as this in the year 1643. did, <hi>viz.</hi> after two Conjuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in the <hi>Fiery Trigon?</hi> And who is there now living that can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſeal to the truth of ſuch prepoſterous Effects, that have attended the Engliſh Monarchy theſe laſt 20 years?</p>
               <p>But let us now obſerve, that after this digreſſion (if I may ſo term it) of the ſuperiour Planets, Almighty providence hath ordained them in this their next meeting <hi>Anno</hi> 1663. to return again to their former path, and there to make conjunction, not onely in the ſame <hi>Triplicity,</hi> but very neer to the place of their firſt meeting therein.</p>
               <p>From whence we may with good reaſon conjecture, that thoſe Kingdomes or Common-wealths, thoſe Monarchies, States and Governments, all thoſe Families and perſons, as had either original or progreſſe to greater Dignity or Authority, from the influence of the <hi>Great Conjunction</hi> of the year 1603. or of that <hi>Minor Conjunction Anno</hi> 1623. And which during the effects of that prepoſterous Congreſſe <hi>Anno</hi> 1643. did receive reſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and almoſt total ſubverſion, ſhall from the effects of this Reſtitution of the Superiours be again <hi>reſtored,</hi> and firmly eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed upon their former principles; and all thoſe Schiſms, Hereſies, and factious Inclinations, that were predominant in the unruly minds of men, will be either totally aboliſhed, or greatly ſuppreſſed; ſo that all matters, both in Church and State, ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally ſhall be reduced to their priſtine beauty and luſtre, and for theſe next twenty years ſhall continue in great Glory and Majeſty; although perhaps afterwards matters may for ſome time be carried on with greater auſterity, &amp;c. Yet will not theſe things be altogether free from Diſturbances, Moleſtations, and diſlikes of a ruder ſort of diſtempered ſpirits, eſpecially the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer part of the Effects of the Conjunction; or eſpecially till <hi>Saturn</hi> and <hi>Jupiter</hi> do make their firſt <hi>Sextile</hi> Aſpect. For the <hi>Comet</hi> which appeared in the year 1652. in oppoſition to the Great Conjunction; which alſo exhauſted mens ſpirits to <hi>Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion, Tyranny, &amp;c.</hi> is yet cooperating with the effects of this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction we now treat of, and ſo will be for ſome years; which conjunction is almoſt directly in oppoſition to the place in which the Comet firſt appeared.</p>
               <pb n="25" facs="tcp:41577:18"/>
               <p>And although we cannot obtain the hour of the Conjunction ſo preciſely, yet this is certain, that the <hi>Moon</hi> that day (and I do believe near the true time) paſſeth by the forementioned Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met, and applies to the oppoſition of the Conjunction, and <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury</hi> (her diſpoſitor) in that pernicious Sign <hi>Scorpio,</hi> having lately been in Square with <hi>Mars.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Hence I ſay, although from the prerogative of <hi>Jupiter</hi> in the Conjunction, we may expect much Tranquillity and Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and that matters ſhould be carried on with much mild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and ſobriety, in matters both Legal, Political, and Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious; yet there will appear a factious and diſtempered kind of people, of the rural or more common ſort, men of unſetled judgements, that I ſay, will moleſt and diſturb the peace of the Kingdome, and of all thoſe places where otherwiſe the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volent influence of the Conjunction will operate; and what they cannot accompliſh by force (by reaſon that both the <hi>Moon</hi> and <hi>Mercury</hi> are weak, and <hi>Mars</hi> diſpoſing of <hi>Mercury)</hi> they will endeavour by private Conſpiracy, falſe Rumours, and ſedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious Pamphlets, nay and ſometimes by tumultuous Inſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions.</p>
               <p>I cannot call this Conjunction Great, although it be as it were a reſtitution of the <hi>Fiery Trigon,</hi> conſidering that irregular one of the year 1643. Yet let me tell you the effects thereon de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending will be no ſmall moment, in all or moſt of the <hi>King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes</hi> and <hi>Common-wealths</hi> of the world; but more eſpecially in the <hi>European</hi> and <hi>Chriſtian</hi> part thereof, by reaſon of the Great Conjunction it ſelf, and other eminent cauſes.</p>
               <p>For, beſides the Great Conjunction <hi>Anno</hi> 1603, there was alſo in the year following a moſt eminent <hi>New Star,</hi> which continued viſible about 16 moneths in a moſt ſplendent manner; whoſe place of appearance was not onely in this <hi>Fiery Trigon</hi> alſo, but in or neer the <hi>Aſcendent</hi> of the Great Conjunction, as it was carefully obſerved by Sir <hi>Chriſtopher Heydon,</hi> and <hi>Jo. Kepler.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now our preſent Conjunction being ſo near the place of the Great Conjunction 1603, the Aſcendent thereof, and the <hi>new Star</hi> of the year 1604. (for the Great Conjunction was about the 8th. deg. of <hi>Sagittary,</hi> the <hi>Aſcendent</hi> and <hi>new Star</hi> about the 18 deg. of the ſame ſign, and our preſent Conjunction in the 14
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:41577:19"/> deg. thereof) interpoſing the Conjunction and new Star; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out doubt very eminent effects muſt be expected to happen du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the effects of the <hi>Fiery Trigon</hi> in general: And what was more particularly ſignified by the great Conjunction, and in a more eſpecial manner by the <hi>new Light,</hi> whoſe effects muſt conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue during the influence of the whole <hi>Trigon,</hi> and certainly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>notes ſome extraordinary effects to enſue therefrom, by reaſon it appeared ſo near the beginning of the <hi>Fiery Trigon</hi> (that is the firſt entrance of the Superiours therein) and continued ſo ſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent in the ſame place for above one year; I ſay, the effects hereon depending ſhall be exceedingly renewed, excited, put forward, and in an eſpecial manner manifeſted to the world, by the influence of our preſent Conjunction, ſeeing it hath ſo neer alliance to thoſe eminent preceding cauſes.</p>
               <p>And therefore it was not in vain, that which <hi>Cardanus</hi> and other of the Learned adviſeth, <hi>Cum videris conjunctionem vel op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitionem ſuperiorum in triplicitate Ignea vel Aeria, non feſtines ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dieium, nec idem tradas in rebus parvis, maxime ſi Sol vel duo de ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioribus in ipſis Triplicitatibus manſerint; praeeminentes enim ſint hae duae ab aliis triplicitatibus, prima quidem in celſitudine &amp; gloriae, ſecunda vero in bonitate &amp; profanditate inge<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

When thou ſeeſt a Conjunction (or an Oppoſition) of the ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour Planets in the <hi>Fiery</hi> or <hi>Airy Triplicity,</hi> be not haſty to give judgement; neither let it be of ſmall matters, (eſpecially if the <hi>Sun,</hi> or two of the Superiours be in thoſe Triplicites) for the actions of theſe are praeeminent above the other Triplicities; thoſe of the firſt or <hi>Fiery Triplicity</hi> do exceed in height and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; thoſe of the <hi>Airy</hi> do ſignifie or operate in Goodneſs and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foundneſſe of Wit.</p>
               <p>Notable to this purpoſe is that of Mr. <hi>Lillies</hi> in his <hi>An. tene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broſ. pag.</hi> 26.

               </p>
               <p>And that which is yet further worthy of note, is, that ſeeing the Conjunctions of <hi>Mars</hi> with <hi>Saturn</hi> or <hi>Jupiter</hi> (according to the precepts of <hi>Albumazar, Leovitius,</hi> and other Aſtrologers) are
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:41577:19"/> neceſſarily to be conſidered to the magnifying of the Effects of great Conjunctions; let us obſerve that <hi>Mars</hi> doth make two Conjunctions with <hi>Saturn</hi> in this very Sign, (not to be neglect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed) one in the latter end of the year preceding <hi>(viz.)</hi> in <hi>Novemb.</hi> 1662. in the 6 deg. of <hi>Sagittary,</hi> which was neer the place of the great Conjunction 1603. The ſecond happens in the year after our preſent Conjunction, in the 27 deg. of the ſame Sign, and near the place of the <hi>Sun</hi> in the ſaid great Conjunction, his place now being neer the ſame it was at the Conjunction 1623.</p>
               <p>Nor is it unworthy of our obſervation, that in the latter end of the year 1662. there was no leſſe than 9 Conjunctions of the Planets (beſides Lunar Conjunctions) in this very Sign <hi>Sagittary,</hi> which (of the 120 Conjunctions <hi>Ptolomy</hi> adviſeth us to conſider, <hi>Aphor.</hi> 50.) are of very principal concernment; the rather, as they are the <hi>Prodromi</hi> of this ſuperiour conjunction; <hi>Memorabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le aliquod ſignificant, plures planetae conjuncti eodem ſigno:</hi> When ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Planets are conjoyned in one and the ſame Sign (or Diviſion of Heaven) they ſignifie ſomething memorable to happen to the world. Not that ſuch accidents are ſignified by theſe infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour Conjunctions: For by the 39 of <hi>Ludov. de Reg. Cum ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioribus nunquam judicia de rebus parvis, cumque inferioribus de rebus magnis, trades.</hi> As from the Superiours we are not to judge of ſmall or trivial matters to enſue, ſo neither of great matters from the Inferiours: For according to the 282 of <hi>Anonymus</hi> (or an unknown Author) <hi>Conjunctio ſuperiorum efficacior &amp; utilior infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riorum.</hi> The Conjunction of the Superiours is more efficacious than of the Inferiours.</p>
               <p>Nor let any miſtake me, or think by theſe eminent tranſacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons <note place="margin">Nota.</note> I here judge may enſue; that I accord with thoſe erronious Judgements, who from the Conjunctions (or rather Poſition) of all the Planets in this ſign, the firſt of <hi>December</hi> 1662. that the conſummation of the Univerſe, or that the calling of the Jewes, or a Fifth Monarchy (as ſome have vainly conjectured) is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by ſignified I do only urge, that ſeeing this Harmony of Celeſtial Configurations, and ſuch an agreement of natural Cauſes, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially of the Great Conjunction and New Star, It cannot be with any ſound reaſon (as ſome on the other ſide have vainly) imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, but that the <hi>Almighty</hi> doth hereby ſignifie unto us ſome
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:41577:20"/> grand Mutations and Accidents to happen in the world, from the effects of this laſt return of the Superiours; and thoſe in an eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial manner to be manifeſted theſe next twenty yeares, being excited by the influence of this Conjunction we now treat of.</p>
               <p>Therefore, for the better finding out what thoſe events more particularly are, it is neceſſary that (by the 51 of <hi>Hermes)</hi> that we conſider thoſe eminent preceding Cauſes, ſeverally and apart, eſpecially of the Great Conjunction and New Star, who have the general diſpoſition of the times for almoſt 200 years, from the year 1603.</p>

               <p>And ſeeing the nature and property of this Triplicity (by the general conſent of the Learned) is diametrically contrary to the former; it may be rationally conjectured that the more emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent changes and alterations are likely to happen, ere the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects thereof be at a period. Undoubtedly there will be a great ſuppreſſion (if not a total ſubverſion) of ſome Ancient Digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, Laws, Cuſtoms, Privileges, Monarchies, Kingdoms, and Commonwealths, and alſo of ſome ancient Families who had their firſt foundation of greatneſſe, from the effects of thoſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding configurations; And either the Erection or reſtauration of others; who muſt continue in great Glory and Majeſty, and ſhall be firmly eſtabliſhed, during the effects of this revolution<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Congreſſe; or till ſome contrary Configurations of Heaven do produce their diſſolution.</p>
               <p>So many Planets poſited in the ſign of the Conjunction (ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating and applying) conſidering alſo that the Conjunctions of <hi>Mars</hi> the year following with <hi>Sat.</hi> firſt, then with <hi>Jupit.</hi> both neer the place of the great Conjunction, and the Aſcendent of <hi>London,</hi> theſe may induce us to conceive, that ſome more than ordinary effects are to be ſignified by this return of the Superious into the <hi>Fiery Triplicity.</hi> I ſay more than perhaps hath uſually happened, from any or moſt of thoſe that have preceded ſince the Creation of the World, and that amongſt other places, <hi>London,</hi> and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally the whole Nation is herein concerned.</p>
               <p>And what thoſe effects are, <hi>Campanella</hi> and others do inform us. <hi>Sub Arietis triangulo ſunt Monarchiae ingentes, leges juſtae, ſapi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entes divinorum, pietas bona coeli &amp; Europes in noſtro Hemiſpherio;</hi> Under the Triangle of <hi>Aries</hi> (which is the firſt, and called the <hi>Fiery Trigon)</hi> are mighty Monarchies erected, juſt Laws; the <hi>Europians</hi> of our Hemiſphere will be more pious, and ſearchers after divine things.</p>

                  <hi>Tranquillitas, pax, ex Solis &amp; Jovis dominio;</hi> Tranquillity and Peace, by reaſon of the dominion of the <hi>Sun</hi> and <hi>Jupiter: Item ſapientes inſignes, ſterilitates magna ob Triangulum Igenum.</hi> Alſo wiſe and famous men do appear in the world, great barrenneſſe
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:41577:21"/> in many places, becauſe it is the Fiery Triplicity, and the Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets that have dominion therein are more hot and dry, than moiſt.</p>
               <p>And ſeeing it is the Sign <hi>Sagittary,</hi> in which theſe ſuperiour Planets, <hi>Saturn</hi> and <hi>Jupiter</hi> do make their firſt Conjunction (by the doctrine taught us in the 59 pag. of <hi>Merl. Proph.)</hi> the world ſeems weary of former wars, and upon ſmall intreaties will be ready to hearken to peace. Some ancient Family decaying, and a new one repairing and exalted; an appearance of Schiſms and new Doctrines, but none privileged by Authority; the Church troubled with curious niceties, men ſtumbling at Straws, and leaping over Blocks; the Majeſty of <hi>Jupiter</hi> is ſuch in <hi>Sagittarius,</hi> all things tend to peace, and do the Devil and Jeſuits what they can, there will be tranquillity in moſt parts of Chriſtendom, during the firſt twenty years of that Trigons government; all the actions of thoſe years ending in Treaties, Leagues, Meſſages, and the like; many men will be in hope to aſpire to greatneſſe; the end crowns onely one: but becauſe the Sign is double bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>died, two Generations paſs not without ſuperlative diſcord to the actions and beginnings of this Conjunction, much double dealing among men.</p>
               <p>I need not repeat what hath happened in the affairs of the World from the year 1603. to the year 1643. in which happen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that prepoſterous Conjunction in the <hi>Watry Trigon;</hi> they may be yet remembred, or called to mind by looking a little back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward; let it ſuffice to note in general, that ſoon after this great Conjunction, very notable Mutations happened in the World; the Engliſh and Scotiſh Monarchy was conjoyned in King <hi>James,</hi> a general Peace over all <hi>Europe,</hi> divers years of Drought, and great Scarcity, and Dearth.</p>
               <p>But this is not all, there are yet many notable Tranſactions to happen the world from the effects hereof; <hi>Signum bi-corporeum ſignificant homines &amp; reges, Majestratus, &amp;c.

By-corporeal or double bodied Signs do ſignifie or operate moſt upon Man, and of Men upon Kings, Magiſtrates, and Rulers in any Kingdome or Common-wealth; therefore (as Sir <hi>Chriſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher Heydon</hi> hath it) the effects hereof may be applied to mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters and perſons both of <hi>State</hi> and <hi>Religion.</hi>

               <p>And if we do conſider the nature of the <hi>Star,</hi> which for the moſt part is <hi>Martial,</hi> the conſtellation being generally received to be alſo of a malevolent nature; and that the <hi>Moon,</hi> who is diſpoſed of by <hi>Mercury,</hi> is ſeparating from an oppoſition of <hi>Mercury</hi> and the conjoyned Planets, and applies to an oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Sol</hi> and <hi>Venus,</hi> the Conjunction it ſelf, and <hi>Mercury</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo neer this violent fixed <hi>Star,</hi> with the forementioned Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile of <hi>Mars.</hi>

Yet let me not omit the judgement of Mr. <hi>Lilly</hi> upon this Conjunction, <hi>viz.</hi> That GOD will reſtrain Monarchical pomp, and reduce all to an <hi>Ariſtocratical mediocrity</hi> both in Church and State: But before this be effected, <hi>Omnia nutu unius regentur,</hi> as <hi>Cardane</hi> long ſince predicted; after which God will give ſo long a peace, and ſuch tranquillity to the Earth, as ſhe never enjoyed the like; in the mean time (ſaith he) as <hi>Saturn, Jupiter,</hi> and <hi>Mercury,</hi> in the Scheme are in the 12th.

               </argument>
               <p>
                  <hi>ANno</hi> 1604. about the beginning of <hi>October,</hi> this Star was obſerved firſt to appear in the Heavens, whoſe effects co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>operate with the Great Conjunction, becauſe it appeared ſo near the place and time thereof, and by reaſon of its ſtability and long continuance; the greatneſſe of which effects are known by its Place, Magnitude, Diſtance from the Earth, its form, colour, and time of continuance.</p>
               <p>For its Place (although there is ſome ſmall diſcrepancy among Authors) it was obſerved and generally concluded to be in the 17 degr. and about 40 minutes from <hi>Sagittary,</hi> with 1 degree 54 minutes North Latitude, ſo that (I ſay) it was not much elongated from the place of the Great Conjunction, which evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently ſhews the concordancy of its effects therewith.</p>
               <p>For its Magnitude, <hi>Ricciolus</hi> and others ſay, it was bigger than <hi>Jupiter</hi> or <hi>Venus,</hi> as to its apparent Diameter and viſible quantity; but <hi>Kepler, Spineus,</hi> and ſome <gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ers do ſay, that it was indeed bigger than <hi>Jupiter,</hi> but not altogether ſo big as <hi>Venus;</hi> For certain its apparent magnitude was more than any of the fixed Stars, whence alſo the effects are of the greater mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>As for its Diſtance from the Earth, its nullity or inſenſible
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:41577:23"/> paralax (by the conſent of all <hi>Aſtronomers)</hi> ſhews it to be ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate among the fixed Stars far above the planetary Orbs; For (as <hi>Spineus</hi> hath expreſſed it) from <hi>Jupiter</hi> and <hi>Mars,</hi> it was ſo much diſtant every day, as was their Diurnal motion; ſo that by its equidiſtance from the fixed Stars, it appears it was fixed alſo, and had no motion at all in Longitude, as the Planets and other wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering Comets uſually have.</p>
               <p>In Form it was exactly round, caſting no hairs or tail con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly to one place, but more like to the order and apparent cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome of the other fixed Stars, it appeared with a moſt clear twinkling and ſhooting of beams on every ſide, and that with ſuch gliſtering and ſudden brandiſhing, as hath not been uſually ſeen or obſerved to be in the Heavens among the Stars.</p>
               <p>The Colours (as muſt alſo the effects be) were very variable, like (in the ſimile of <hi>Spineus)</hi> to a many-angled Diamond, by which turning the Sun-beams upon the eys of the beholders, will reflect with a variable brightneſſe, ſo from a bright Yellow (ſaith he) anon it became Croceal, and in a moment like a Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and reddiſh, and many times it did appear white, and with a moſt pure twinkling light.</p>
               <p>Its Continuance was above a year, even till the moneth of <hi>Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bruary</hi> 1605/6. and conſtantly in the ſame part of Heaven, as to its Longitude in the Ecliptick: And notable to our purpoſe is that obſervation of <hi>Kepler, That all the Planets were in conjunction with this Star, before it was extinguiſhed:</hi> to which I may add, that its firſt appearance was neer the times of the conjunctions of <hi>Saturn</hi> and <hi>Jupiter</hi> with <hi>Mars,</hi> as by the following Figure appeareth.</p>
               <p>This is the true Hiſtorical relation of this rare <hi>Phenomenon,</hi> or unuſual appearance; which though it be brief, yet is it as full as is neceſſary to our preſent purpoſe. But who would be further ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied, I refer to <hi>Ricciolus</hi> his <hi>Almageſtum Novum,</hi> and <hi>Kepler, de Stella Nova.</hi>

And by its Habit to the Sun, the time thereof in general; for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering that it was occidental of the Sun, and ſo appeared not till after the Sun-ſet, <hi>viz.</hi> was <hi>vespertine,</hi> if we may apply the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of <hi>Ptolomy,</hi> then muſt not the effects thereof be ſo ſudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly manifeſted to the world; but as the Sun did approach nearer and nearer, and ſo by degrees, and for ſome time did obſcure the light of the Star, ſo will the effects be obſcured or retarded for ſome time, or till excited by ſubſequent Configurations; yet ſo, as that it muſt cooperate with the Conjunction, becauſe it was neer the Aſcendent thereof; or we may from hence infer, that as the great Conjunction was Oriental and Matutine, and ſo might denote ſome ſudden changes and alterations to happen in the world, or that the effects thereof ſhould quickly be manifeſted; and that after <hi>Saturn</hi> and <hi>Jupiter</hi> were ſeparated one from ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and were about to make their conjunctions with <hi>Mars,</hi> for the further augmentation of their effects; that then this <hi>Star</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared <hi>occidental</hi> (as hath been already mentioned) neer to the place of the Conjunction, denoting, that at length, and even be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the effects of the Conjunction are compleated, muſt there be ſome eminent and more than ordinary accidents to happen to the world.</p>
               <p>Very little hath hitherto been taught us by the Aſtrologers, of the effects of theſe or ſuch like Prodigies of Nature, ſo that we cannot attain ſo exactly to the particular events. We may ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally conclude from extraordinary Cauſes, that ſome extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Events will enſue; and from Aſtrological principles and grounds of Nature conjecture, from ſuch inordinate ſignatures as inordinate and prodigious effects muſt happen.</p>
               <p>The judicious do ſay (ſaith <hi>Spineus) Circa illam partem, in quae pſeudoſtella refulxit aſcendere virum aurum viſu repraeſentantem.</hi> That about that part of Heaven in which a <hi>Mock-ſtar</hi> appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, ſhall a man ariſe, which in ſhew ſhall reſemble Gold; <hi>Come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes in oriente maximi exortum ſignificat viri magni legum latoris,</hi> ſaith <hi>Cardanus Segm. 2.

Immovable Comets do ſignifie Seditions, and being in the Fiery Triplicity it excites Wars, Commotions, Conflagrations, &amp;c. to happen in the world; And this the rather, for that the Star was of a <hi>Mars</hi>-like colour; yet ſeeing at length it appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of a more bright and <hi>Mercurial</hi> colour (or rather a <hi>Jovial) Spineus</hi> will have it, after ſo many misfortunes; as Wars, Sediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, Burnings, Slaughters, &amp;c. to ſignifie the Kingdome of Peace; with him we may conclude, that there will be great change of Laws and Cuſtomes, Deſtruction and Detriment to divers States and Monarchies, beyond what is ſignified from the great Conjunction, for elſe why was it viſible ſo neer the place and time thereof?</p>
               <p>To which we may adde that notable obſervation of Sir <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtopher Heydon;</hi> that as <hi>Saturn</hi> was elevated above <hi>Jupiter,</hi> and ſo might ſeem to retard or remit the benevolent influence of <hi>Jupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> in the Conjunctional effects (who was otherwiſe better dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified) yet this <hi>Star,</hi> when <hi>Saturn</hi> came to paſſe by him, was ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated above him, which doth alſo further evidence the greatneſs of the effects of this <hi>New Star;</hi> and what <hi>Saturn</hi> would do by Subtilty, Craft, Hypocriſie, ſelf ends, &amp;c. ſhall in a great mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure by this New Light be diſcovered and ſuppreſſed, whether it be by new Laws or Decrees, in matters either Civil or Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtical.</p>
               <p>And foraſmuch as this Star was fixed and ſituate above the planetary Orbs, even among the fixed Stars, and that the Sun al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo among the Planets the year following, ſuffered an Eclipſe in the <hi>M.

               <p>So that as the <hi>Sun, metaphorically</hi> repreſenteth Kings and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates, and Nobility in <hi>Aſtrology</hi> are reſembled to the Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets about the <hi>Sun,</hi> ſo the fixed Stars are compared to the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple and Commons, among whom ſome excell others in Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe; and therefore, whether there be a new <hi>Democracy</hi> or <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtocracy</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>Common-wealth,</hi> founded while the <hi>Sun</hi> ſuffereth his light to be <hi>eclipſed,</hi> I take not upon me to decide; but he conceived there would be a breach of Leagues and Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and a renovation of the Wars, great detriment to the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> that he ſhould be beaten out of the <hi>Indies,</hi> and the <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel</hi> ſhould be propagated unto the Southern parts: For to what end is this Star perpendicular to the Indian Seas, and to the beſt parts of <hi>America?</hi> if we conſider the place of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Conſidering that all the Planets, except the <hi>Moon,</hi> are <hi>ſubter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranean,</hi> that <hi>Saturn, Jupiter,</hi> and <hi>Mars,</hi> and the <hi>New Star,</hi> are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercepted in the fourth Houſe, without doubt it will be long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the effects will manifeſt themſelves fully to the world, which at length will be the more effectual, becauſe the firſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance thereof was ſo neer the conjunctions of <hi>Saturn</hi> and <hi>Jupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> with <hi>Mars,</hi> and all nigh the place of the Great Conjunction and the Aſcendent thereof; and therefore I may add, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe our preſent Conjunction is ſo neer theſe former Configu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, therefore the effects thereof ſhall in abundant meaſure ſhew themſelves theſe next twenty years, and likewiſe during the effects of every of thoſe Conjunctions that ſhall happen in this ſign <hi>Sagittarius,</hi> ſo long as the influence of the <hi>Fiery Triplicity</hi> ſhall continue.</p>
               <p>But what thoſe effects yet further are, give me leave alſo to add the judgement of <hi>Spineus</hi> in his <hi>Cataſtrophe mundi,</hi> where (treating of the <hi>Mock-ſtars</hi> of the years 1572. and 1604. he ſaith, That the appearance of this Star in the <hi>Fiery Triplicity,</hi> and (as he terms it) in the direct of <hi>Sagittary,</hi> ſignifies the vehemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of ſome King over his people; his coveting of moneys, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing of many of his ſubjects by violence and injuſtice; the

               <p>And further, without doubt in the latter years there will be almoſt a deſtruction of Monarchies eſpecially, becauſe of the moſt powerful influence of the Stars that then will happen; we conceive (ſaith he) not onely the final deſtruction of the <hi>Turks,</hi> but alſo that there will be a great decay among <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> and that not onely all the <hi>Kings</hi> and <hi>Potentates</hi> of the Earth ſhall be hurt by the ſeveral evil Conſtellations of Heaven, But take heed all you <hi>KINGS</hi> of <hi>SPAIN</hi> and <hi>FRANCE;</hi>

               <p>God divert the Evil that is yet further portended from the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of this <hi>Star,</hi> from the Kingdom of <hi>England;</hi> for ſeeing the Star did firſt appear ſo neer the body of <hi>Mars,</hi> and that <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn</hi> was alſo applying, whoſe influence <hi>Mars</hi> tranſlates firſt to the <hi>New Star,</hi> afterwards to <hi>Jupiter;</hi> it may probably be conjectured, that many violent and turbulent accidents muſt enſue in the world, which as they do proceed from ſuch natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral cauſes, whoſe influences are univerſal, ſo that all places more or leſſe ſhall be ſenſible of the effects; therefore <hi>England</hi> cannot be excluded, and the rather, becauſe we are under a ſign of the ſame Triangularity: But if we conſider the dominion of the Sign it ſelf, or their ſituation in Heaven, the effects are for certain extended to the more Southern parts of the World, and ſuch as are both South-Eaſt and South-Weſt from <hi>England;</hi> and in <hi>Europe,</hi> more particularly <hi>Spain, France, Italy, Portugal,</hi> &amp;c.

                  <p>Of the other Leſſer Conjunctions, <hi>Anno</hi> 1623. <hi>and</hi> 1643.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>OF theſe we are not to take any great notice, ſeeing the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects extended but to the following 20 years after each Conjunction; among which we may not forget that the death of King <hi>James</hi> ſucceeded the Conjunction of the year 1623. and that King <hi>Charls,</hi> whoſe Aſcendent was the ſign of the Conjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction; came by rightful ſucceſſion to the Crown; there was alſo ſeveral years of great Drought, Scarcity, and a moſt furious Plague.</p>

                  </gap> afflicts the City of <hi>London</hi> with a Plague; and as at other times it hath been obſerved, ſo God grant it not to be ſo now: But truly, when I conſider (beſide the Tranſit of <hi>Saturn</hi> through the ſign <hi>Sagittary)</hi> that beſides other Enormities great Plagues have alſo ſucceeded thoſe preceding Conjunctions of the years <note place="margin">☞</note> 1603. and 1623. &amp; that there are alſo two conjunctions of <hi>Saturn</hi> and <hi>Mars</hi> in the ſame Sign; me thinks we have too great cauſe to fear an approaching Plague, and that a very great one, ere the year 1665. be expired; I dare not be poſitive in ſuch determinations, but I ſay, from theſe reaſons taken from ſuch eminent natural cauſes, it is greatly to be feared; and if we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider how the Fruits of the Earth have been corrupted by intem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate ſeaſons and unwholſome airs, and thence a great deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of Cattel, we cannot but look on thoſe alſo as the <hi>Prodro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi</hi> of the ſame; and how hath <hi>Almighty God</hi> viſited moſt Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons about us, and a long time ſpared us? <hi>(LIBERA LIBERA NOS DOMINE.)</hi> Notable is that expreſſion of Mr. <hi>Lilly's;</hi> We in <hi>England</hi> (ſaith he) have had two of our beſt Princes fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed with two <hi>Great Plagues, viz.</hi> Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> 1603. and
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:41577:27"/> King <hi>James</hi> 1625. There's a Myſterie in it, if I durſt unfold it. <hi>God</hi> grant we have no more ſuch <hi>Plagues,</hi> I wiſh ſuch <hi>Princes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I onely further note in this Conjunction of the year 1623. that as <hi>Mars</hi> his next Aſpect is a <hi>Quartile</hi> with the <hi>Moon,</hi> who tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlates the light and malevolent influence of <hi>Mars</hi> to the <hi>Sun</hi> by a hoſtile Aſpect, <hi>viz.</hi> a Square from <hi>Cardinal</hi> Signs, and that the <hi>Sun</hi> being ſeparated from the Oppoſition of <hi>Mars,</hi> applies next to the Conjunction of <hi>Saturn</hi> and <hi>Jupiter,</hi> doth evidently denote moſt violent Tranſactions to enſue, though not ſuddenly, becauſe of the diſtance of the degrees; which if we convert into time, <hi>viz.</hi> of the <hi>Moon</hi> to the Quadrate of the <hi>Sun,</hi> and <hi>Mars</hi> to his oppoſite place, it gives about 16 or 17 years, which brings us to the years 1639. or 40. And who knows not what troubles were then agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tating and beginning to come upon us?</p>
               <p>And ſeeing that the place of <hi>Mars</hi> at the time of our preſent Conjunction, is the place of the Conjunction of the year 1623. (or near it) which ſign being the Aſcendent of <hi>Rome,</hi> and of <hi>Italy</hi> in general, it threatens detriment to them eſpecially, by <hi>Fires, Tumults, War,</hi> and ſuch like Enormities; by which means thoſe who eſpecially had the Original of their greatneſſe from the effects of that Conjunction, ſhall be depoſed, and loſe much of their Honour and Dignity, whiles others by ſome Noble He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roick Exploits, and principal Martial performances, will be ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated to greater dignity and power, which will be alſo of longer continuance.</p>
               <p>But as for the Conjunction in 1643. which, according to the uſual order of the Superiours, ſhould have happened in <hi>Aries,</hi> and ſo have made their third Conjunction in the <hi>Fiery Trigon;</hi> but contrarily it happened in <hi>Piſces,</hi> which is a ſign of the laſt <hi>Tripli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city,</hi> ſo that after two Conjunctions made in the <hi>Fiery Triplicity,</hi> this prepoſterouſly comes in to finiſh the period of the former <hi>Triangularity.</hi>

               <p>But if we conſider moreover the malevolent configurations of the Planets, at the time of the Conjunction; <hi>Mars</hi> is neer the oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite place of <hi>Mercury</hi> and the Conjunction of the year 1603. the <hi>Sun</hi> ſeparating from his Quadrature, and applying next to the place of the Conjunction: the <hi>Moon</hi> ſeparated from the body of <hi>Mars</hi> and Square of the <hi>Sun,</hi> is in Square to <hi>Mercury,</hi> and oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of the Aſcendent of the great Conjunction and <hi>New Star,</hi> and applies next to the Square of a Conjunction: All which (I ſay) conſidered, are all <hi>Arguments</hi> in <hi>Aſtrology,</hi> of much Faction and Diviſion, of much turbulency and diſturbance in Affairs, which although they were carried on under pretence of Religion and Juſtice, Rights and Liberties of the people, yet were the intents of thoſe Enormities nothing but ſelf-ends; and who knows not how fraudulently and deceitfully matters were performed, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they were at firſt otherwiſe pretended.</p>
               <p>Thoſe who pleaſe to obſerve the diſtances of the foremention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Aſpects, and convert them into time, as is already preſcribed, or as is more preciſely uſed in the determination of the effects of our preſent Conjunction, may ſee how thoſe times did concur with the directions.

               <p>Which becauſe they are particularly handled by Mr. <hi>Lilly,</hi> Mr. <hi>Booker,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Wharton,</hi> I ſhall onely make ſome general obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations conducible to our preſent purpoſe, as they are concomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant with the influence of this Conjunction.</p>
               <p>And that which therefore is moſt obſervable, is, that the place in which this prodigious <hi>Comet</hi> was firſt obſerved to be, was in the exact place of the <hi>Moon,</hi> and oppoſite to the place of the great Conjunction, <hi>Anno</hi> 1603. and the New Star of the year 1604. which alſo is in oppoſition to our preſent Conjunction; ſo muſt we expect that what inordinate effects are thereby ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, are ſuch as muſt contradict or diſturb the influences of thoſe more eminent cauſes.</p>
               <p>And if (as by the conſent of the Learned) thoſe Conjunctions did ſignifie the erection of ſome new <hi>Monarchies, Empires</hi> and <hi>Dominions</hi> in the world, ſome new <hi>Laws</hi> and <hi>Cuſtomes, Ceremonies</hi> and <hi>Privileges,</hi> both in Church and State, ſo likewiſe from the effects of this <hi>Comet,</hi> ſhould thoſe <hi>Laws</hi> and <hi>Cuſtomes, &amp;c.</hi> receive
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:41577:29"/> great alteration and diſturbance; and who knows not the great change of <hi>Government,</hi> and conſequently of <hi>Cuſtomes</hi> and <hi>Privile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges</hi> that ſucceeded and happened the year following in <hi>England,</hi> as the influence of this <hi>Comet</hi> and the great Eclipſe of the <hi>Sun</hi> in <hi>Aries</hi> the preceding <hi>March;</hi> which Eclipſe ſignified ſome <hi>new Government,</hi> which by reaſon of the contrary effects of this <hi>Comet</hi> to thoſe <hi>preceding cauſes,</hi> muſt be by the ſubverſion and abroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of the former <hi>Power, Laws</hi> and <hi>Cuſtomes,</hi> and not as that of the coming of King <hi>James</hi> from <hi>Scotland</hi> to the <hi>Crown</hi> and <hi>Regal Government</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> which was in <hi>peace</hi> and <hi>tranquillity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And ſeeing from the influence of our <hi>preſent Conjunction,</hi> which (as hath been already mentioned) is ſo neer the place of the <hi>great Conjunction</hi> and <hi>new Star,</hi> all thoſe former <hi>Rights</hi> and <hi>Privileges, Laws</hi> and <hi>Cuſtomes</hi> ſhall be reſtored, and thoſe exorbitant abuſes both in Church and State aboliſhed; yet we may infer from hence, that ſeeing the effects of this <hi>Comet</hi> do co-operate yet for ſeveral years to come; therefore will not the effects of the Conjunction take place, without great troubles and diſturbances to enſue.</p>
               <p>And although (for the forementioned conſiderations) we may moſt rationally conclude, that <hi>Almighty God</hi> hath ſome great and eminent work to do, and doth ſignifie to us ſome extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry events to happen in the world by this laſt reſtitution of the Superiours, which ſhall be augmented and excited, or ſtirred up and put forward by the influence of the <hi>New Star,</hi> and that thoſe wonderfull events will in a great meaſure be manifeſted theſe next 20 yeares, by reaſon of the concurrence of the Conjuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with thoſe preceding Configurations; yet I ſay (by the 32 of <hi>Rigel.</hi> forementioned) will mens minds, or the minds of ſome men be excited by this prepoſterous Comet (if I may ſo call it) to <hi>Miſchief, Sedition, Inſurrection</hi> and <hi>Diſturbance,</hi> to <hi>ſecret Conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racies, Mutinies,</hi> and <hi>Rebellions,</hi> and all ſuch irregular Enormities, as ſuch malevolent ſpirits can be capable of contriving; which by reaſon of the Retrograde motion of this <hi>Comet,</hi> and that with ſuch celerity or ſwiftneſſe, cannot but redound to their own de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction or detriment, in as much as alſo it oppoſed thoſe more regular, and more natural and accuſtomary cauſes, which indeed have the more principal and general diſpoſition of the times. So

<pb n="50" facs="tcp:41577:31"/> hath ſhewn me a Treatiſe) of another <hi>Comet</hi> that was ſeenin <hi>Germany Anno.</hi> 1661.</p>
               <p>But ſeeing from the influences of theſe there hath happen'd ſuch great and grievous <hi>Calamities,</hi> &amp; beſides what ſucceeded not long <note place="margin">☞ The ſucceſs of the preſent de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns of the Turks proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly conjectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rep.</note> after the <hi>Comet</hi> here in <hi>Engl.

               <p>For as thoſe violent and inordinate accidents do happen from thoſe unnatural, unuſual, and irregular cauſes, and this <hi>Comet</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing ſo oppoſite to the great Conjunctions of the ſuperiour Planets, which are more natural and regular, ſo it may be conje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctured, that the fury of thoſe Evils and Calamities that do happen from thence, will not, neither cannot continue long; but either (as was ſaid before) by a forcible retrograde motion in their affairs, or a willing condeſcenſion by little and little, they (as the <hi>Comet)</hi> come at length to be extinguiſhed or appeaſed.</p>
               <p>Again, ſeeing (by 77 <hi>Aphor.</hi> of <hi>Daſipodius)</hi> that the <hi>Fiery Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity</hi> hath moſt ſignification of the <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> and the <hi>Roman Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire</hi> (by the conſent of <hi>Cardane)</hi> ſo many Planets in that <hi>Trigon</hi> ſo benevolently configurated, eſpecially that <hi>Mars</hi> who is in <hi>Leo,</hi> is ſaluted with the <hi>Trine</hi> of <hi>Venus,</hi> and applying to the <hi>Trine</hi> of the <hi>Conjunction;</hi> I ſay, that what cannot be accompliſhed by Treaties (of which there will not be wanting the aſſiſtance of divers Princes and Potentates) will by the power of the Sword, though with labour and difficulty, wherein one Heroick ſpirit attains to great Honour, by his more than ordinary Martial Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and Atchievements.</p>
               <p>To which we add the reaſon already mentioned, <hi>pag.</hi> 32. that as the Law and Religion of <hi>Mahomet</hi> &amp; the Turks had their riſe from the <hi>Watry Triplicity;</hi> ſo now from the effects of this <hi>Sabba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thical</hi> return of the Superiours into the <hi>Fiery Trigon</hi> (ſo accounted by ſome, and almoſt all the Ancient <hi>Aſtrologians,</hi> which diſtinction is queſtioned by ſome now) muſt that Law &amp; Empire receive great reſtriction and abatement of its power and
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:41577:31"/> Dominion, if not a finall and totall Subverſion.</p>
               <p>For what Law, Religion, Rule or Government, had its ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal of riſe or greatneſſe from the celeſtial Influences, muſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect to receive great detriment and moleſtation from contrary cauſes; ſo that becauſe the effects of this returne ſhall moſt powerfully operate, and be put forward by the effects of this Conjunction of the year 1663. therefore (I ſay again) all thoſe enormities that do ariſe from contrary cauſes to theſe, muſt ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily be ſubverted and exſtinguiſhed.</p>
               <p>And although I take not upon me to judge the time preciſely when the period of theſe <hi>Revolutions</hi> ſhall be; yet ſeeing they were excited hereunto by the Conjunction of <hi>Saturn</hi> and <hi>Mars Anno</hi> 1662. which happened neer the place of the great Conjunction <hi>Anno</hi> 1603. and this of 63, ſo I conceive that from the effects of their ſecond Conjunction in the year 1664. in the ſame Sign (if not before) will they receive their final and full period of proſecuting any further deſigns at this time againſt the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians.</p>
               <p>So that I dare preſume to conjecture from theſe natural prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, that the Turk will not be ſo ſucceſsful in his attempts upon <hi>Europe</hi> as ſome (and indeed with great reaſon) have feared; but that either matters will be reconciled by Treaties, Embaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies and Solicitations, or he will be forced by the Chriſtian Sword to retire.</p>
               <p>And if we do but conſult with the Hiſtories of former times, and that frequently after the apparition of ſuch like unaccuſtom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed prodigies, we ſhall read of divers invaſions of the Turks into <hi>Hungaria, Bohemia, Germany, &amp;c.</hi> and that with almoſt innume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Armies, in which they have made great ſpoyl and havock, and cauſed great deſolation among the Chriſtians, yet hath God in his infinite Mercy been pleaſed to deliver them (as he did of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten times the children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> againſt the <hi>Philiſtines)</hi> by far leſſe power and force, and contrary to all humane reaſon; And who ſhould now diſtruſt his Power and Will? <hi>Surge ô Domine, Ariſe, ariſe ô Lord and help,)</hi> Notwithſtanding I have heard of ſome Atheiſtical wretches, who moſt blaſphemouſly and audaciouſly have asked, Where is now your crucified <hi>Saviour?</hi> why doth he not come down and ſave his <hi>People?</hi> &amp;c.

               <p>But again to the <hi>Comet;</hi> It is a Generall rule, that all thoſe places more or leſſe ſhall be ſenſible of the effects, in which they appear; therefore this Comet being viſible, not onely to <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope,</hi> but alſo to more remote parts of the World, the Influence thereof is the more Univerſal and not reſtrained to thoſe fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned places only; but if we take it as to its declination, then from the effects of its firſt appearance, the more Southern parts of the world muſt alſo ſhare therein: From the Sign, <hi>England, France,</hi> but eſpecially <hi>Spain</hi> muſt alſo have a great portion there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, and that eſpecially towards the latter part of the time deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined, becauſe it then becomes neareſt Verticall to thoſe places.</p>
               <p>If we conſider the Figure of Heaven at the Lunation, which was without doubt about the beginning of its appearance, we ſhall find but an untoward poſition; for the two Malevolents do afflict the principal <hi>Angles, Saturn</hi> in the Meridian, and <hi>Mars</hi> neer the Aſcendent or Horoſcope; they alſo malevolently be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the Fortunes, who are in abject places; <hi>Saturn</hi> is in <hi>Quartile</hi> to <hi>Venus,</hi> and <hi>Mars</hi> (who is neer the oppoſite place of the great Eclipſe) is applying to a <hi>Square</hi> of <hi>Jupiter;</hi> the <hi>Moon,</hi> after her oppoſition with the <hi>Sun,</hi> applies to an oppoſition of <hi>Mercury</hi> and the place of the <hi>Comet:</hi> The tenth Houſe ſignifies KINGS; The <hi>Aſcendent</hi> and the <hi>Moon</hi> the <hi>People;</hi> both are afflicted, and both will ſuffer; <hi>Kings, Emperours,</hi> and <hi>Governours,</hi> by Fraud, Treachery, Sorrow, Fear, Depopulations of divers of their Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritories and Dominions, the people they will in a great meaſure ſuffer by Oppreſſion, Warre, Fire and Swotd, Impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and ſuch like.</p>

               <p>Not onely the Lunation but alſo the Comet it ſelf happened in the ninth Houſe of Heaven; <hi>Mercury,</hi> who is Lord of the ninth is in the third in his detriment and combuſt of the <hi>Sun,</hi> the <hi>Moon</hi> applying next to his oppoſition, out of thoſe houſes which have ſignification of Religion and the Laws of Kingdomes and Nations; ſo that much of the matters and accidents attending this Comet will happen by reaſon of ſome niceties in Religion, there will happen (as it is to be feared) great hazard and ſpoyl of the Church in many places: For ſo <hi>Cardanus</hi> doth alſo inform us, <hi>Segm. 5.

               <p>This <hi>Comet</hi> (as we mentioned before) appeared very conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuous, the Diurnal motion thereof (as appears by the foregoing Table) was very ſwift: its firſt appearance was in the ninth of the Lunation; but by its irregular Retrograde motion it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended to the eighth, even to the Cuſp thereof; but as to its vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility in the part of Heaven at the firſt obſervation, and at the new Moon following, it was in the twelfth and eleventh houſes of Heaven; we may therefore rationally judge, that what acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents ſoever are hereby portended, whether by War from Forei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, the change of ſome Empire, &amp;c. according to <hi>Cardane;</hi>

                  <p>Of the Conjunction of <hi>Saturn</hi> and <hi>Mars,</hi> and other Leſſer Conjunctions of the Planets, <hi>Anno</hi> 1662.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>THere were alſo (as the <hi>Prodromi</hi> of this Conjunction of the year 1663.) no leſſe than 15 Conjunctions together of the Planets among themſelves, in the latter end of the year 62. nine of which were in this very ſign <hi>Sagittary;</hi> which although of themſelves they produce no ſuch grand effects (as I ſaid before) yet becauſe they have generally ſuch coherence with our preſent Conjunction, and thoſe eminent preceding cauſes, we may the rather (according to the 50 <hi>Propoſ.</hi> of <hi>Ptolomy)</hi> take the more cognizance thereof; and the rather, becauſe that at the Lunati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which was on the 30. of <hi>Novemb.</hi> in that year, the <hi>Moon</hi> was paſſing by all the Planets in that very Sign in which all theſe moſt eminent Configurations have happened, <hi>viz. Sagittary,</hi> which by the forementioned <hi>Aphoriſm</hi> of <hi>Anonimus,</hi> ſignifie ſomething me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morable to happen to the World; But I have already given cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that theſe muſt be looked upon onely as the promoters and forerunners of thoſe great effects that attend thoſe more principal cauſes, whatever are or have been the high con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions of ſome.</p>
               <p>The moſt principal of theſe Conjunctions, and that which is more remarkable as to our preſent purpoſe is the Conjunction of <hi>Saturn</hi> and <hi>Mars</hi> the 5 of <hi>Novemb.</hi> in that year 1662. in the 6 degree of <hi>Sagittary,</hi> whoſe effects do particularly operate but till the latter end of the year 1664. at what time they make Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:41577:34"/> again in the latter degrees of the ſame Sign, and neer the place of the <hi>Sun</hi> in the great Conjunction; this Conjunction of the year 1662, being in the place of <hi>Mercury,</hi> and very neer, <hi>viz.</hi> within or about two degrees of the great Conjunction, and not far elongated from the place of our preſent Conjunction of the year 1663. the <hi>New Star</hi> 1604. and the oppoſite place to the <hi>Comet</hi> 1652. I ſay, by reaſon of theſe great Concomitances of the great Conjunction, and this in 63. this Conjunction of <hi>Saturn</hi> and <hi>Mars</hi> is the more remarkable, becauſe it certainly excites the influence of the one, and prepares matter for the effects of the other.</p>
               <p>And therefore ſeeing the Conjunctions of <hi>Saturn</hi> and <hi>Mars</hi> (according to the doctrine of <hi>Haly</hi> in his <hi>Jud. Aſtror.</hi> and other <hi>Aſtrologers)</hi> do of themſelves cauſe notable tranſacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as ſudden Commotions, Uproars, ſometimes War, Murders, and very violent and cruel Enormities in thoſe places that are under the dominion of the <hi>Sign</hi> in which they are conjoyned, and this happening with ſuch relation to thoſe eminent cauſes; it is then no marvel that from hence alſo we hear of very grand Tranſactions in thoſe places of the World, even before this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction of <hi>Saturn</hi> and <hi>Jupiter</hi> doth happen, and can take place to operate.</p>
               <p>And (which I muſt now add) who is there that is not ſenſible of very eminent Tranſactions, to have brake forth in thoſe places which have been chiefly ſubject to that very <hi>Sign</hi> and <hi>Trigon, viz.</hi> in <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>Portugal, France</hi> and <hi>Italy, Germany, Hungaria,</hi> &amp;c? and more yet are likely to happen, either there or in other places of the world, becauſe it hath yet a longer time to operate; and I ſay, muſt prepare matter for the Conjunction of <hi>Saturn</hi> and <hi>Jupiter,</hi> and ſeconded by another Conjunction in the ſame <hi>Trigon;</hi> ſo that by the way I may alſo note to you, that although (as I mentioned before) the Conjunctions of <hi>Saturn</hi> and <hi>Mars</hi> do work ſuddenly, violently, and generally operate but two years; yet becauſe of theſe notable concurrences ſo often (though but neceſſarily) mentioned, it may be conjectured, that they may extend their influence to a longer time, <hi>viz.</hi> till the year 1666. or till <hi>Mars</hi> comes to the place of the Conjunction of <hi>Saturn</hi> and <hi>Jupiter,</hi> of which he wants about 7 degrees from his Conjunction
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:41577:34"/> with <hi>Saturn;</hi> However, ſeeing there are certainly yet a longer time for the effects thereof, and that among other enormities that have already happened in Forein parts, the <hi>Plague</hi> hath late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly afflicted many Countreys; I muſt once again take notice, that ſeeing the power of <hi>Mars</hi> is ſo great at his Conjunction with <hi>Saturn,</hi> and being with the <hi>Scorpions</hi> heart a moſt violent fixed <hi>Star</hi> of his own nature, there being other reaſons which I men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned before; theſe I ſay do give cauſe from natural grounds to fear an eminent Plague or peſtilent Diſeaſe to afflict us, ere the effects be at a period <hi>(Quod Deus avertat.)</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And although <hi>Mars</hi> hath ſuch power to excite <hi>Wars, Sediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, Tumults, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>proars, Murthers, Fires, &amp;c.</hi> yet by reaſon <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn</hi> hath greater elevation, as well by Latitude, as in his Orbite, and approaching to his <hi>Aphelion,</hi> ſo it may be feared that he will produce great Scarcity and want, if not a Famine in ſome of thoſe places ſubject to the influence of the Conjunction, from both great Drought, deſtruction of Catell, and Mortality among men, Shipwracks at Sea; and theſe the rather, becauſe the <hi>Moon</hi> agrees with <hi>Saturn</hi> in Latitude, which (by the 132 of <hi>Almanſ.</hi> and the 91 <hi>Aph. Segm. 5. Cardani)</hi> doth add to his ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue and power with whom ſhe ſo agrees in Latitude, which I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand is when ſhe paſſeth by them in Conjunction, to whoſe beams ſhe is neareſt united.</p>
               <p>I have no more of any moment to ſay of this Conjunction of <hi>Saturn</hi> and <hi>Mars;</hi> but that as thoſe grievous Enormities that have happened in the world, have ſucceeded their Conjunction, and may well be attributed to their malevolent effects, ſo I hope that much of their violence will be taken off by the effects of this Conjunction of <hi>Saturn</hi> and <hi>Jupiter,</hi> of which I am coming now more eſpecially and particularly to treat, having both as fully and as briefly as I cloud, touched all thoſe things as were directly neceſſary to the proſecution of our preſent ſubject.

               <argument>
                  <p>The quality of the Events attending the Conjunction of <hi>Saturn</hi> and <hi>Jupiter</hi> more particularly.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>WHich muſt be known by the nature of the Planets that are conjoyned, and which hath the greater power and fortitude, the place in which they are conjoyned, with relation either by Poſition or Aſpect to other Planets, or that have dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity in the Conjunction.</p>
               <p>As for the Planets themſelves, you may remember I told you they were the two Superiours, <hi>Saturn</hi> and <hi>Jupiter,</hi> who have the chiefeſt ſignification of the order and governing the times, of the moſt material changes and accidents that do happen in the world, all other Configurations of Heaven, or that are made among the Planets, are ſubordinate to their influences.</p>
               <p>That this their Conjunction is in the Fiery, Regal, and moſt eminent Triplicity, and the third Conjunction they have made therein, ſince this their laſt return, which is the ſeventh return in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to this Triplicity, ſince the Creation of the World, and will there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore produce the more eminent effects.</p>
               <p>And becauſe that after an inordinate Conjunction that inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vened in contrary parts of Heaven, which produced as contrary effects; this Conjunction happens in the ſign of the great Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction and New Star, and ſo makes a reſtauration (as it were) of the <hi>Fiery Trigon;</hi> which becauſe it hath ſuch relation to all the forementioned cauſes and configurations of the Heavenly bodies, do certainly denote unto us the greatneſs of the accidents to hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen from this laſt return in general; and that thoſe accidents ſhall more eſpecially be manifeſted theſe next 20 years from the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of this preſent Conjunction.</p>
               <p>Theſe conſiderations being already handled in the foregoing diſcourſe, let us now come to particulars, wherein we muſt firſt conſider the Planets themſelves; of both, becauſe it a conjunction of two; <hi>Cum duo ſimul planetae dominantur, erit judicium ambo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum ſignificatio mixto;</hi> when two Planets together do rule, the
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:41577:35"/> judgement ſhall be a mixt ſignification of both.</p>
               <p>One of theſe Planets (as <hi>Saturn)</hi> is an infortunate and very malevolent, deſtructive, and inimical; the other (as <hi>Jupiter)</hi> is a fotunate, benevolent, and friendly to Nature; <hi>Et generaliter ſi fuerit infortuna fortunae copulata, &amp; infortuna elevata fierint duae in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunae, nihil firmè juvanies, ſed multum nocentes; quod ſi fortuna elevatur infortuna juvabit quidem, ſed &amp; nocebit, &amp;c.</hi> Cardan. Segm. 5. Aph. 122, 123. And generally if an Infortune be joyned to a Fortune, and the Infortune be more elevated, both are made In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes, helping nothing firmly, but hurting much; and if the Infortune be depreſſed he may do ſome good, but he will alſo do much hurt; <hi>Quoniam detrimenta magna facilius est inferre, quam felicitates, impediuntque detrimenta magna faelicitates, felicitates autem detrimenta impedire non ſolent.</hi> Becauſe, ſaith he, great detriments are more eaſily inferred than happineſſes, and detriments do uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally impedite felicities; but felicities are not wont to impedite or keep back miſchiefs.</p>
               <p>But beſides this elevation here ſpoken of, which (as Mr. <hi>Lilly</hi> obſerves) was of great eſteem among the Ancients; it is the judgement &amp; precepts of the more judicious <hi>Aſtrologians,</hi> ſince the time of <hi>Ptolomy,</hi> that the Fortitudes and Dignities of the Signifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cator is alſo to be conſidered; ſo <hi>Almanſor Propoſ.</hi> 60. but more plainly and full by <hi>Cardanus</hi> himſelf, <hi>Seg. 2. Aphor. 189. In omni conjunctione planetarum, eum planetam dominatorem conſtitue, qui ſublimior, &amp; qui in loco plures habuerit dignitates, &amp; plures ſtellas ſuae naturae ſimiles.</hi> In every conjunction of the Planets conſtitute him Ruler, that is the moſt ſuperiour in his excentrick (that is neereſt his Aphelion) and hath moſt dignities in the place of the Conjunction, and the fixed <hi>Stars</hi> that they are with, are moſt of his nature. This (I ſay) is the judgement of all <hi>(vid. Proph. Mer. pag. 75. &amp; Seq.)</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In our preſent Conjunction <hi>Saturn</hi> is moſt elevated, having about one degree more North Latitude, and being neer the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periour part of his <hi>Orbite;</hi> but <hi>Jupiter</hi> is better dignified, as to eſſential dignities, therefore both the forecited <hi>Aphoriſmes</hi> of <hi>Cardane</hi> are in force; and it is a general rule, <hi>Quod ligat Saturnus Jupiter diſſolvit, &amp; haec ſignificatio eſt ſuper res magnas,</hi> that what <hi>Saturn</hi> binds or hinders, <hi>Jupiter</hi> diſſolves or furthers, and this
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:41577:36"/> hath ſignification of great matters, ſaith <hi>Almanſ. Propoſ.</hi> 36. and by 51 <hi>Propoſit.</hi> If the Fortunes have dignity in thoſe places; <hi>Minuitur malitia infortunarum,</hi> the malice of the Infortunes is diminiſhed; or (by the 18th. of <hi>Anohim.)</hi> is made more mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate and temperate.</p>
               <p>By all which we may gather thus much, that ſeeing from the influence of ſuch like conjunctions of the Planets, <hi>viz.</hi> of <hi>Saturn</hi> and <hi>Jupiter,</hi> there uſually ſucceeds ſuch ſuperlative Tranſactions, deep Conſultations, and matters of great moment in the world; what miſchief ſoever is portended by <hi>Saturn</hi> in this Conjunction (which will not be a little to ſome perſons and in ſome places) will not be ſo vigorous, or at all times ſo efficacious, and in ſuch a plentiful manner executed, by reaſon of the greater prerogative of <hi>Jupiter,</hi> yet ſo as what general benefit and felicity <hi>Jupiter</hi> doth promiſe to mankind herein, will be remitted, retarded, and ſometime abrogated by the malignant power of <hi>Saturn.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If you examine the dignities of each Planet, you ſhall finde <hi>Jupiter</hi> to be more ſtrong, though it be by few teſtimonies; yet is he eſſentially dignified, and onely ſuffers by affliction from <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn,</hi> whoſe dignities and ſupport are chiefly from <hi>Jupiter</hi> and <hi>Venus:</hi> Oh what Craft and Subtilty, what Fraud and Hypocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, &amp;c. will there be uſed even by thoſe who receive their Intereſts, Being, and Subſiſtence from others! yea, even againſt thoſe very perſons that do intruſt them, and this as well among great perſons, as thoſe of lower degree.</p>
               <p>For from <hi>Saturn</hi> is ſignified matters Political and Civil, all ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til and politick Counſels, Deceitful, private and cunning Stratagems, Covetouſneſſe, Self-ends, Deſtruction to ſome an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Family and Buildings; in this Conjunction to Lawes, Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties, Cuſtomes, and Privileges, Depopulations, &amp;c. this he ſignifies in Political matters.</p>
               <p>In Eccleſiaſtical affairs he portends great Superſtition, Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, Hypocriſie, Monkery, Jeſuitiſm, and the ſeveral Orders of Friers; all manner of Debauchery and Baſeneſſe under Religious pretences, Sects, Schiſmes, Hereſies, Jewiſh Superſtitions and Ceremonies.</p>
               <p>To Mankind in general he threatens great and difficult La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, Poverty and Want to many; he afflicts the body with te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:41577:36"/> Infirmities and Diſeaſes, as the Gout of all ſorts, the Scia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tica eſpecially, becauſe in <hi>Sagittary,</hi> Hectique Fevers, Defluction of Rheum, Quartan Agues, and ſuch like Diſeaſes as are not ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily remedied by the moſt skilful Phyſician; he afflicts the mind with Sorrow, Fear, Lamentation, Trouble, Baniſhment, long Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſonment.</p>
               <p>In Natural things he portends great Want and Scarcity, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of Cattel, Corn and Fruits, Famine and Mortality, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wholſom Airs, Cold, Cloudy, Miſty, Foggy weather, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times long and tedious Froſts.</p>
               <p>At Sea he ſignifies Shipwracks, and great damage by Ruine and Decay, by Inundations of Waters, and breaking of Sea-banks, Dearth and Scarcity of Fiſh and Fowl, eſpecially Water-Fowl.</p>
               <p>Of Perſons he ſignifies thoſe of Superiour Rank and Quality, becauſe he is the moſt ſuperiour of the Planets, <hi>Rarò applicatur Saturnus alteri Planetae, quare propter hos ſignificat magnos Principes &amp; Monarchas ſtabiles.</hi> Anonim. 35. <hi>Saturn</hi> ſeldom applieth to another Planet, but generally all the other Planets to him, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he ſignifies great Princes and ſtable Monarchs; but gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally he ſignifies the laborious Countrey-man, Husbandman, Farmers, Yeomen, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>In our Conjunction he ſignifies a deceitful, ſordid, pernicious kind of people, who will inhabit even in the Courts of Kings and Princes, who will undermine and deceive, endeavour to ſpoil and ſubvert the more wholſom purpoſes intended, to ſet up and promote their own Intereſt and Profit.</p>
               <p>This (I ſay) is the general ſignification of <hi>Saturn,</hi> which in ſome meaſure, at ſome time, and in ſome places, will be manifeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, according as his influence is augmented or excited by thoſe <hi>Revolutions, Eclipſes, leſſer Conjunctions</hi> of the <hi>Planets,</hi> or other <hi>Configurations</hi> of Heaven; but with this caution, that theſe or ſuch like accidents muſt not be expected to happen in all places nor at all times alike, as well for the reaſon before rendered, as the benevolency of <hi>Jupiter,</hi> with whom he is in conjunction.</p>
               <p>From <hi>Jupiter,</hi> who is here oppreſſed by <hi>Saturn</hi> (as much as in him lies) we judge of Religion, and all ſorts of Religious men, the Laws of Nations, and the practitioners thereof of all degrees;
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:41577:37"/> he ſignifies (when and where he rules) much Integrity, Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightneſſe, Juſtice and Faithfulneſſe among men, great Peace and Tranquillity obtained by Prudence and Moderation, Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion exercifed with much purity and ſincerity of Life and Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, juſt Laws freely executed, the Rulers and Magiſtrates much honoured and reverenced, the People receiving great Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice and benefits from their Princes, Honours conferred on ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, new Laws, Cuſtomes, and Privileges beſtowed.</p>
               <p>He generally ſignifies Plenty and Increaſe of all things for the benefit of Man, health of Body, tranquillity of Mind, wholſom and feaſonable Air, fortunate Voyages by Sea, and as proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Endeavours by Land, and generally remits all the Evils <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn</hi> can inflict upon a Kingdom or Nation.</p>
               <p>And verily, were it not for the power of <hi>Saturn</hi> (though it be by accidental fortitudes, as was mentioned before) there were great hopes that <hi>Jupiter</hi> would operate to purpoſe: nor will there be great endeavours wanting, which in the end will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail though with difficulty, and that with ſome variation and uncertainty; for double bodied Signs do ſignify things not to continue long in a ſtation; and (I ſay, from the power of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn)</hi> there will be ſuch ſecret Conſultations and Juglings, ſuch private ends and fraudulent pretences uſed both in matters of State, and alſo of Religion, that the honeſt intents and purpoſes of <hi>Jupiter, (viz.</hi> of Magiſtrate and Divine) will receive great Reſtriction, and ſometime ſuppreſſion, though not to a total ſubverſion or extirpation.</p>
               <p>For both Planets having ſuch power in the Conjunction, <hi>viz. Saturn</hi> being almoſt equally dignified, both will ſtruggle hard (that is) the policy of a Saturnine, Malevolent, and Jeſuitical ſpirited people, and the more moderate diſpoſition of the Jovia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſt; and although thoſe perſons and matters (or many of thoſe) ſignified by <hi>Jupiter,</hi> ſhall be much ſuppreſt, debaſed, and ſuffer much in their ſeveral functions and degrees, and inſtead thereof many ſordid and indigent perſons, and ſuch as are of more wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked and ſuperſtitious diſpoſitions, exalted and promoted into their privileges and prerogatives; yet I ſay again, will they not ſo prevail, but that <hi>Jupiter</hi> will have time to exerciſe his more bene volent influence; ſo that in the end Religion and Religious
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:41577:37"/> men in truth ſhall be exalted, juſt Laws executed, the juſt Rights, Privileges, and peace among the people, reſtored and eſtabliſhed.</p>
               <p>But let us hear what Authors ſay to this matter; <hi>Haly de Jud. Aſtr.</hi> pag. 8. informs us, <hi>Si Jupiter fuerit junctus Saturno, nobiles &amp; alti homines, judices &amp; largi &amp; factores bonorum operum diſtruen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur, &amp; ſignificat mortem Regis alti &amp; potentes multas locuſtas, &amp; damnum in divitibus;</hi> If <hi>Jupiter</hi> be joyned to <hi>Saturn,</hi> Noble-men, and of high degree, Judges, and ſuch as are inclined to do good, will be deſtroyed; ſome great and potent King will die, there will be many Locuſts <hi>(Anglicè</hi> Catterpillers) great detriment and hurt among rich men; <hi>Si Saturnus elevetur ſupra Jovem, ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficat quod interficieutur nobiles &amp; alti homines;</hi> if <hi>Saturn</hi> be ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated above <hi>Jupiter,</hi> he ſignifies ſlaughters among Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Eſcuidus</hi> fol. 30. tells us there will be, <hi>Infortunia in pluribus cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matibus, multa bella in Babylonia &amp; mortem Regis ejus, &amp; rumores terribiles;</hi> many misfortunes happen in ſeveral climates of the Earth, much war in <hi>Babylon,</hi> the death of the King thereof, ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible rumours alſo will enſue; <hi>Prohibetur omne malum a poteſtate Jovis,</hi> ſaith <hi>Haly;</hi> From the power of <hi>Jupiter</hi> all theſe evils ſhall be leſſened; and beſides the power of <hi>Jupiter</hi> in the place of the Conjunction, there is an eminent Fixed Star, which is partly of the nature of <hi>Jupiter,</hi> not much elongated from the place of their Conjunction, yea almoſt ariſeth with the degree of their Conjunction: From all which we cannot but judge from the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence of this Conjunction, that very high and notable Conſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations and Debates about the ſettling of matters both in Church and State, and removing of thoſe obſtructions that may hinder the peace and ſafety of both, which will not onely be ſtrongly endeavoured, but notwithſtanding all difficulties, will in the end be accompliſhed; for <hi>Jupiter</hi> is alſo more aſſiſted by the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of <hi>Venus</hi> than <hi>Saturn</hi> is, by reaſon of the more Southerly latitude, from whence we may judge great Treaties and mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Solicitations will be uſed.</p>
               <p>Notable to our purpoſe is that of <hi>Bonatus,</hi> fol. 324. <hi>Si Jupiter Saturno corporaliter junctus, erunt opera quae homines facient cum ſilen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio, &amp; operabuntur per modum religionis, &amp; cum apparitione fidei &amp;
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:41577:38"/> obſervatione praeceptorum juſticia.</hi> If <hi>Jupiter</hi> be corporally joyned to <hi>Saturn,</hi> the actions of men ſhall be performed with much ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence and ſecrecy, under pretence of Religion, and with ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of Faith, and the obſervation of the precepts or commands of Juſtice.</p>
               <p>If we conſider the habit of theſe Planets to the <hi>Sun,</hi> we ſhall find them occidental; nor doth the <hi>Sun</hi> behold them by any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Aſpect, being ſeparated from their Sextile about 14 degrees, ſo that we may note by the way, that it may be long ere much of the effects do manifeſt themſelves; but matters for ſome ſpace of time will be carried very obſcurely and ptivately, <hi>Effectus planetae orientalis cit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> ſolet apparere, occidentalis tardè. Anonim.</hi> 59. At the time of the Lunations, both before and after the Conjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, not onely the Conjunction it ſelf, but alſo all the Planets, except the <hi>Moon,</hi> are ſubterranean, or under the Earth.</p>
               <p>If we conſider the Revolution of the year in which this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction happens, which we are adviſed to conſider by <hi>Cardane, Seg. 2. Aphor. 187. Nam magna eveniunt juxta domus naturam;</hi> for great things do happen according to the nature of that houſes the place of the Conjunction is then alſo in the fifth houſe, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering into the fourth <hi>(ex Tab. Carol.)</hi> ſo that ſtill they are ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terranean, which doth further ſhew the great privacy, under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand dealing, and obſcurity of things before they are fully ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſted. So <hi>Ptolomy</hi> hath it, <hi>Aphor. 26. Latet plane res, quum ftel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la eam ſignificans ant ſub terra eſt, aut in alieno loco ſoli conjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitur, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And yet both Planets are ſwift of courſe, which denotes the celerity or readineſs of many to propagate ſuch matters, and the vehemency of things that are obſcurely hatched, although they cannot ſo ſuddenly break forth.</p>
               <p>And although the aforeſaid Aphoriſm of <hi>Cardane</hi> cannot be applied to an Univerſal judgment, becauſe revolutional Figures are varied by reaſon of the difference of Meridians, &amp; the ſeveral elevations of the <hi>Pole,</hi> yet this is very obſervable, that at the time of the Vernal Ingreſs theſe two ſuperiour Planets were very near their Conjunction, neither were they much Elongated all the year, even till the time of their true Conjunction. Which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration, together with the ſeveral Conjunctions of the
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:41577:38"/> Planets, the latter end of the preceding year (eſpecially of <hi>Saturn</hi> and <hi>Mars)</hi> in the ſame ſign; theſe I ſay are very notable, for as much as from hence matters were preparing forcibly for the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of this Conjunction; though perhaps not manifeſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ſo powerfully, as when the Conjunction it ſelf begins to operate.</p>
               <p>At the time of the Conjunction the <hi>Sun</hi> is ſeparated from the <hi>Sextile</hi> of <hi>Saturn</hi> and <hi>Jupiter, Mars</hi> applies to their <hi>Trine, Venus</hi> is the place of the great Conjunction, 1603. applies to a Trine of <hi>Mars,</hi> and to the bodies of <hi>Saturn</hi> and <hi>Jupiter;</hi> but before ſhe comes to theſe, ſhe becomes Retrograde; what may we from hence judge, but that certainly the endevours of many will be for Peace and Reconciliation of Differences, for quieting the fears and jealouſies of the people, and the ſuppreſſing of that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignant humour that is the cauſe of their ſorrow, grief and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints? but ſome are diſcouraged, and are either willing or forced to fall off, their Embaſſes prevailing but little, or having not liberty to treat, the <hi>Sun</hi> is weak in his Fall, and <hi>Saturn</hi> and <hi>Jupiter</hi> are poſſeſſed of his dignities in part; he <hi>(viz.</hi> Kings, Emperours, &amp;c.) have not power to prevail, many are dejected; <hi>Mars,</hi> who is diſpoſed of by the <hi>Sun,</hi> is very powerful in a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding Sign, with majeſtical <hi>Stars</hi> of his own nature, and hath great dominion in the Lunations preceding and ſubſequent, ſo that what he cannot effect by Martial policy (which indeed will be very prevalent) he will conclude by force and violence.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Moon</hi> at the time of the Conjunction, is in or neer to an oppoſition of the Conjunction, diſpoſed of by <hi>Mercury,</hi> who is malevolently poſited in that treacherous and pernicious Sign <hi>Scorpio,</hi> lately in Square with <hi>Mars</hi> his Diſpoſitor, the place of the <hi>Moon</hi> being neer the ſame, as at the great Conjunction, and of the Comet 1652. Good God! what a multitude of factious and unſettled Judgements there are alſo in ſome places, that will plot, contrive, and oppoſe the Superlative Conſultations of the Superiours, and cauſe Tumults, Inſurrections, and various Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbances, though to their own deſtruction? She is elevated above the <hi>Sun,</hi> if we either conſider her as being in a command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Sign, &amp; ſo great North Declination; or her poſition in the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure of the preceding Lunation. And, <hi>Si magna conjunctio fiat in tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plitate
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:41577:39"/> Ignea, &amp; Luna elevatur ſupra ſolem, rebellabunt populi adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus proprios principes.</hi> Anon. 65.</p>
               <p>When firſt I had thoughts of writing upon this Conjunction, and conſidering the great dominion of <hi>Jupiter</hi> therein, and that there was no malevolent Aſpects among the Planets, or to the Conjunction it ſelf, except thoſe of the <hi>Moon</hi> and <hi>Mercury;</hi> but that the <hi>Sun</hi> a little before, even then when they were within one degree of their Conjunction, was in <hi>Sextile,</hi> firſt to <hi>Jupiter,</hi> then to <hi>Saturn,</hi> tranſlating the <hi>Sextile</hi> vertue of <hi>Mars</hi> to <hi>Jupiter;</hi> of both to <hi>Saturn; Mars</hi> applying by <hi>Trine</hi> to the Conjunction; theſe being the whole (or the general) Configurations of the Planets at and about the time of the Conjunction; I ſay, conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring theſe, I had thoughts much good might have been expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from the effects of the Conjunction, that is to ſay, that Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quillity and Peace ſhould have been eſtabliſhed, Religion and Religious men propagated, encouraged, and purely and with ſincerity exerciſed; juſt and wholſome Laws, Priviledges, and Cuſtomes, reſtored and executed; without doubt there will not onely be much endeavour uſed to promote theſe things in ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral places of the world, but alſo there will be at ſome times, and in ſeveral places, an accompliſhment thereof.</p>
               <p>But when I found <hi>Saturn</hi> to have alſo ſuch power by accident, and that he did ſuppreſſe <hi>Jupiter</hi> by being more elevated, and neer his <hi>Aphelion,</hi> ſo that he would not onely have great power and prerogative in ſwaying the Conſultations and Affaires of the world, for theſe next twenty years eſpecially (for the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junctions of the year 83. are in his detriment) but by this his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote diſtance from the Earth, he operates cloſely, ſubtily, and with ſome kind of moderation in his Counſels; and obſerving alſo that the Conjunction was in Oppoſition to the laſt <hi>Comet,</hi> which in its motion oppoſed the place of the <hi>Sun,</hi> the New <hi>Star,</hi> and the great Conjunction it ſelf, it gives us cauſe to fear that which hath been already mentioned, <hi>viz.</hi> that a malevolent kind of ſpirit, will both in matters Politick and Eccleſiaſtick, cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ningly, and for ſelf-ends, endeavour to ſubvert and ſuppreſſe thoſe more ſober and honeſt intents endeavoured for the peace and tranquility of the People, Nations, and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes.</p>
               <pb n="67" facs="tcp:41577:39"/>
               <p>Theſe things (I ſay) have been already mentioned; yet let me not be blamed for repetitions, ſince they are the ſubſtance in general of the whole matter; and indeed I am warranted by <hi>Cardane, Repe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titio in hac ſcientia neceſſarià eſt, vel ob difficultatem, vel ob neceſſitatem, vel ob utilitatem ingentem, vei ob contradictionem;</hi> That repetition in this Science is neceſſary, either by reaſon of the difficulty, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity, great benefit, or to avoid contradiction.</p>
               <p>In <hi>page</hi> 4. of the <hi>Prophetical Merlme,</hi> there is a very notable obſervation of <hi>Ganeverus</hi> upon a Conjunction of <hi>Saturn</hi> and <hi>Jupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> wherein <hi>Saturn</hi> was moſt elevated; <hi>Quod poteſtas Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca in multis partibus opprimetur à temporali poteſtate, maximè in ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiis Eccleſiaſticis;</hi> That therefore the Eccleſiaſtical power in many places will be ſuppreſſed by the Temporal, eſpecially in their ſubſtance and Eccleſiaſtical benefits; ſo will it be endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured in many places of <hi>Europe</hi> from the influence of this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction.</p>
               <p>But that which Sir <hi>Chriſtopher Heydon</hi> obſerved in the great Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juction, is alſo obſervable here in this, <hi>viz.</hi> that as <hi>Saturn,</hi> who is the preſident of Antiquity, doth challenge ſuch prerogative to himſelf, by being ſo elevated above <hi>Jupiter,</hi> and will therefore endeavour to carry on his pernicious and ſubtil Stratagems; yet is the New Stars place elevated above the place of <hi>Saturn</hi> in this Conjunction alſo, for though <hi>Saturn</hi> had 1 <hi>deg. 18 min.</hi> North Latitude, the Star had 1. 54. or thereabouts, by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of all Obſervators, which may therefore further confirm our judgement in this, that although a Saturnine, Cloſe, Hypocriti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal, and Jeſuitical kind of people, may carry on their deſigns ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo privately at ſome time, when they have the moſt conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient opportunity, yet at length muſt thoſe privacies be diſcovered and by the influence of this new light, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it operates in new Laws, Cuſtomes and Privileges, in matters civil, or in new Decrees, Orders or Diſcoveries in matters Eccleſiaſtical, ſhall all thoſe malevolencies ſignified by Saturn, be at length not onely brought to light, but alſo very much ſuppreſſed, if not totally ſubverted. The <hi>Moon</hi> alſo after her oppoſition to the Conjunction, applying to the Trine of the <hi>Sun,</hi> doth well ſignify and confirm ſuch Diſcoveries.</p>
               <p>But for the further diſcovery of the Events attending this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction,
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:41577:40"/> let us conſider the place in which the Planets are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned; For, <hi>In magnis coujunctionibus, ſignum in quo apparet eſſe conſiderandum;</hi> and ſo <hi>Eſeutdus,</hi> Fol. 17. when he comes to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form us of the quality of the Events, attending any eminent Eclipſe, great Conjunction, or other notable Configuration of the Stars, <hi>Hoc ſcietur ex qualitatibus, formis &amp; figuris ſigni conjunctionis, &amp; ſignorum in quibus ſtellae erraticae &amp; non erraticae conſiſtunt;</hi> This is known (ſaith he) from the qualities, forms and figures of the ſign of the Conjunction, and of the Signs in which the fixed Stars and Planets are.</p>
               <p>As for the qualities of the Sign, it is the chief prerogative of <hi>Jupiter;</hi> and therefore the actions of the Conjunction, generally for the next twenty years, will operate much in matters of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, much endeavour being uſed in many places, and accompli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed in others to the reformation and correction of the abuſes thereof; but there muſt alſo be in many places a change of Laws and Cuſtomes, which <hi>Jupiter</hi> alſo ſignifies, and a reſtauration of others, becauſe it happens ſo neer to a Tropical point; which by the 84. of <hi>Daſipodius, Significat mutationem Aeris, legum, morum, &amp;c.</hi> ſignifieth a ſudden change of the Air, of Laws, and Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of men.</p>
               <p>But it may be ſome will ſay, It was not in the Tropick of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pricorn,</hi> or in that Sign. To which I anſwer, that ſeeing they have equal declination, and the place of the Conjunction, having but very little variation from the declination of the Tropick, the judgement holds good.</p>
               <p>So that from hence I ſay, that beſides what is ſignified in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Religion, in which there will be much to do, in thoſe places ſubject to the Sign of the Conjunction (what if you here of a new Councel?) there will alſo happen great alteration of Laws, Cuſtomes, and Privileges, and thoſe mutations rather to the better, new Honours and Dignities conferred upon the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility and Gentry.</p>
               <p>But not onely the Sign it ſelf is herein conſiderable, but alſo the <hi>Triplicity</hi> to which it pertains; and that is the firſt and chie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt of the whole <hi>Zodiack,</hi> which is ſaid to be governed by <hi>Sol</hi> and <hi>Jupiter,</hi> and therefore by the 67 of <hi>Daſipod</hi> ſignifies the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daining or conſtitution of ſome new Empire or Monarchy in the
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:41577:40"/> world, which muſt continue in great Glory and Majeſty; many wiſe and famous men do alſo appear; and though <hi>Mars,</hi> who by the Ancients hath a general prerogative in the <hi>Fiery Trigon,</hi> may at ſome time excite Wars and Commotions, yet they conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue not long; Peace in moſt places is ſuddenly concluded, and there will be Tranquility in the world generally for the ſuccee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding twenty years; but there will be great Drought and Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renneſſe, by reaſon the Planets are more hot and dry than moiſt; and this is confirmed by <hi>Campanella,</hi> which was mentioned be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; and indeed all others have attributed the greater and more ſuperlative Events to procced from the Effects of this <hi>Triplicity, Miros effectus producit magna conjunctio in ſigno Regio. Anon.</hi> 292. A Great Conjunction, in a Regal Sign, produceth wonderful Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects; by <hi>Regal,</hi> here is underſtood the ſigns of the <hi>Fiery Trigon,</hi> according to that of <hi>Cornel. Gemma: Elementi Ignei praedomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mum ad reges civitatumque praefectos, enim ignis agendi efficacia ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xime valet;</hi> The pre-dominion of the Element of Fire pertains to Kings and Governors of Cities, for the efficacy of Fire prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth eſpecially inacting; and when it exceeds its bounds, it breaketh forth with a horrible heat and violence diſſipating and conſuming all things.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Eſcuidus,</hi> Fol. 17. doth alſo inform us, <hi>Quod conjunctio magna, ſi fuerit in ſigno Igneo, ſignificat ſiccitatem &amp; deſtructionem, &amp; gravita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem infortunii,</hi> That great Conjunctions, if they happen in Fiery Signs, drought, deſtruction, and the greatneſs or heavineſs of Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune is ſignified thereby to happen. And although (as formerly I noted) this Conjunction cannot be ſaid to be Great, becauſe it is not the firſt that is made at their return into the <hi>Fiery Trigon,</hi> yet for the reaſon before given, ſeeing after the intervening of a Conjunction in a Sign of contrary nature, they now make con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction, not onely in the ſame <hi>Trigon,</hi> but in the ſame Sign in which the great Conjunction happened, ſo that as it may be ſaid to be a reſtitution of the <hi>Fiery Triplicity</hi> in general, and a promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the effects of the great Conjunction in particular, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Judgements pertaining to great Conjunctions are appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable to this.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Eſcuid. Tract. 1. Diſtinc.</hi> 4. doth further teach us, That, <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turnus cum fuerit aequidiſtans in Sagittario, accident hominibus bubones,
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:41577:41"/> cum vehementibus doloribus oculoru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, interfectio ex parte orientis, angu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiae mulierum, locuſtae, &amp; mortem in avibus;</hi> When <hi>Saturn</hi> hath do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion in any great Eclipſe, Conjunction, or in the reſolutions of the years of the Worldꝭ, and be equidiſtant in <hi>Sagittary,</hi> there will happen ſuch diſtempers among men, as will cauſe Sores and Boyls (I doubt he means the Plague) and vehement griefs in the Eyes; there will happen much Sorrow and Anguiſh among women, Slaughters among men from the Oriental parts; Locuſts alſo will abound, and there will be a great Mortality among Birds; <hi>Si fuerit ejus latitudo ſeptentrionalis, ſignificat flatum ventorum, etſi verſpertinus ſiccitatem.</hi> And if this Latitude be North (as now it is) and veſpertine, he ſignifies great blaſts of Winds, and alſo Drought.</p>
               <p>And becauſe <hi>Jupiter</hi> hath alſo ſuch great prerogative, he informs us in the ſame Diſtinction, and fol. 25. what <hi>Jupiter</hi> ſignifies when he rules and is in <hi>Sagittary, Significat multas infirmitates hominum ex dolore capitis, &amp; praecipue in quarta autumnale; mortem in beſtiis &amp; praecipue in bovis, multas pluvias; Frigus mediocre in principio hyemis, &amp; fortitudinem ejus in medietate ejus, &amp; nov<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>s &amp; deſtructionem panis &amp; fructuum, cum vehementia Caloris in quarta aeſtivaeli, &amp; du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rabilite ventorum orientalium, &amp;c. viz.</hi> that he alſo ſignifies many Infirmities among men from grief in the head, eſpecially in the Autumn of thoſe years in which <hi>Jupitaer</hi> rules; there will be a mortality among Beaſts, eſpecially among Oxen and ſuch great Cattel; in the Winter a mediocrity of cold, but much rain in the beginning thereof; there will be a deſtruction of Corn and Fruits, by reaſon of the vehement heat and drought of the Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, and the long and tedious Eaſterly winds, which if his La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude be alſo North and he Veſpertine, he helps forward or en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſeth the great blaſts and guſts of winds.</p>
               <p>Thus <hi>Jupiter</hi> as he is oppreſſed by <hi>Saturn,</hi> may ſignify ſuch Enor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities, which God divert, eſpecially from this our Native Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey: And indeed, ſeeing <hi>Mars</hi> is ſo powerful in the Conjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and that <hi>Aries,</hi> which is the reputed Aſcendent of <hi>England,</hi> is no wayes afflicted; I do believe that the malevolen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of the Effects generally operates upon Forein parts, more eſpecially as to the mutation of Laws, Religion, Cuſtomes, Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments, and ſuch like, rather then in <hi>Engl.</hi> yet by reaſon of the
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:41577:41"/> forementioned poſition of the <hi>Moon</hi> and <hi>Mercury,</hi> ſome Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbances, Seditions, Inſurrections and Conſpiracies there will be, though to the deſtruction of the Contrivers, becauſe of the debility of both the <hi>Moon</hi> and <hi>Mercury:</hi> And the next Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction of <hi>Saturn</hi> and <hi>Mars, Anno</hi> 1664. co-operating, it may be feared, the Plague, or ſome peſtilent Diſeaſe will afflict us, eſpecially in the year 1665, and 66. (from which once again I pray, <hi>Good Lord deliver us;)</hi> were it not for theſe (I ſay) the Conjunction promiſeth well to <hi>England.</hi> But of this more by and by.</p>
               <p>But the ſame <hi>Eſcuidus,</hi> Fol. 40. yet further tells us what may be ſignified by a Great Conjunction, or an Eclipſe in <hi>Sagittary; Apparebunt in civitatibus &amp; Regionibus ſuper quas dominatur, forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudo Regum &amp; Nobilium, &amp; providentia eorum &amp; aliorum ex popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis; multa fraus, ingenium largitas, congregatio pecuniarum &amp; diſperſio earum; aegritudines multae, &amp; infirmitates ex ſanguine, dolor impregna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarum, multi lupi &amp; beſtiae nocivae;</hi> That then in thoſe places ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to the dominion of that Sign, the Kings and Nobles will fortify, and be more than ordinarily provident for themſelves and their allies, and that by the help and aſſiſtance of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; for there will be much collection, or gathering and diſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of moneys, wherein as well as in other things there will be much fraud and deceit uſed among men; yet will there be many wiſe and famous men, who will be very bountiful of their Knowledge and Underſtanding: But among other things he tells us of many Sickneſſes and Infirmities that the body of man will be afflicted withall, from the corruption of Blood, and that women will ſuffer much grief in their conceiving and bearing of Children.</p>
               <p>And this may very well be, for at the Revolutional Figure <hi>Jupiter</hi> is Lord of the Fifth; ſo alſo at the Poſtventional New <hi>Moon,</hi> neer which place the Conjunction happens, and at the Full <hi>Moon</hi> preceding it happen'd in the Sixth: ſo that not onely various Diſeaſes will afflict the bodies of men in thoſe places, but women will be ſubject (as our Author ſayes) to conceive with grief and pain; there will be many abortive Births, with diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty and hard Labour in Child-bearing, yea, as the Sign is <hi>Bi-corporeal,</hi> I judge there will be more than ordinary Monſtrous
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:41577:42"/> Births in divers places; and withall we may rationally conje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture, according to that of <hi>Cardane</hi> in confirmation thereof, <hi>Seg. 2. Aph.</hi> 204. that during the Effects of this Conjunction, ſome <note place="margin">☞</note> Great Perſon will be born, which muſt be very inſtrumental in thoſe grand action and affairs of the World, which are ſignifyed by this Sabbatical return of the Superiours; and that the end for which this man is born, or the general intent of his attempts, is to change Laws and Religion, that is, for the reformation and correction of the abuſes thereof, which will be performed by great difficulty, and with many obſtructions: But to return to our Author.</p>
               <p>There will be many hurtful Beaſts, as Wolves, and ſuch like, which in thoſe places ſubject thereto, will encreaſe and do much hurt; and if it happen in the Autumnal quarter, and in the North part of the Sign, it prenotes great Winds and Deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive.</p>
               <p>And not unworthy of our notice it is that the place of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction is neer the <hi>Aphelion</hi> of <hi>Saturn,</hi> as was before noted; but that which adds much thereto, is, that the next Conjunction of <hi>Saturn</hi> and <hi>Mars</hi> is neer the very degree thereof; <hi>Si Saturnus fit loco in quo dignitatem habet, gens antiqua locu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> inhabitans quemcunque, devicta non erit, neque de loco ſuo extracta, &amp; propter naturam Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turni, multiplicantur per mundum odia, rancores, turbationes, fames &amp; infirmitatum ſpecies;</hi> If <hi>Saturn</hi> be in a place where he hath dignity; an ancient people inhabiting in what place ſoever, ſhall not be drawn forth, or overcome in their places or habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; but by reaſon of the malignant nature of <hi>Saturn,</hi> Hate, Rancour, Trouble, and divers kinds of Infirmities will be mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplyed. And beſides that Conjunction of <hi>Saturn</hi> and <hi>Mars</hi> hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pening ſo neer the place of the <hi>Sun</hi> in the great Conjunction, it points out great Detriment to ſome great Potentate, or Death, or ſome violent Caſualty to ſome Eminent perſons of <hi>Europe,</hi> eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally to ſuch as had their Original of Greatneſſe from the Effects of the great Conjunction <hi>Anno</hi> 1603. But more particularly where, I ſhall acquaint you by and by: and by the 7 <hi>Segm. Aph.</hi> 124. there will be great Drought and Barrenneſſe, Conflagrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons or great Deſtruction by Fire, during the effects of that Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction, which will continue till the latter end of the year 1666.
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:41577:42"/> but I have no more to ſay to this Conjunction of <hi>Saturn</hi> and <hi>Mars</hi> here.</p>
               <p>Theſe are the general judgements of the Ancients upon theſe and ſuch like Configurations of the Celeſtial bodies when they happen in this Sign, which as it is Regal and Humane, prenotes ſuch actions as are more peculiar to Man, <hi>viz.</hi> to mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Church and State, of Religion, and things Civil and Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litick; and among men, Kings, Emperours, and the greateſt Potentates of the Earth, are principally concerned; and as the <hi>Fiery Triplicity,</hi> it may well ſignify great Drought, Barrenneſſe, or Scarcity, Conflagrations, or ſudden and vehement Deſolati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons by Fire, hot and peſtilent Diſeaſes in the bodies of Men, ſtrange Meteors, or fiery Apparitions in the Air; ſome New Star or Comet appears not long after; ſome ſay or conjecture, in the year 1664. I fear a great Plague in ſixty five or ſixty ſix.</p>
               <p>And of this Trigon, wherein <hi>Jupiter</hi> hath a general dominion, this Sign wherein there hath been ſo many Conjunctions of the Planets, is the proper and chief prerogative of <hi>Jupiter,</hi> which certainly intimates to us ſome grand Counſels or Conſultations about the Reformation of Religion, Laws, Cuſtomes, and Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vileges; <hi>Venus</hi> alſo hath ſomething to do there, the Conjunction being in her Term according to the opinion of <hi>Ptolomy,</hi> and the <hi>Egyptians;</hi> therefore much endeavours there will be for Peace and Tranquillity, many Treaties and Embaſſies for that purpoſe; But ſeeing it falls in the Conſtellation of <hi>Scorpio,</hi> and that <hi>Jupiter</hi> and <hi>Venus</hi> are ſo afflicted by the preſence of <hi>Saturn,</hi> it portends not onely a peſtilent and unwholſom Air, prejudicial to the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies of Men, but that even in the very Courts of Kings and Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces there will be much treachery, fraud, deceitful and pernicious Counſels, many that pretend fair, but perform little or nothing.</p>
               <p>The Conjunction happens in the ſecond <hi>Decanate</hi> of the Sign <hi>Sagittary,</hi> which is diſpoſed of by the <hi>Moon,</hi> who generally ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies great mutability and oft change of Affaits; She is unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunately poſited and diſpoſed of in the Figure by <hi>Mercury,</hi> who diſpoſes of the firſt Decade of this Sign, in which the great Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction happened, and which according to <hi>Albumazar, Jo. Angelus,</hi> and others, ſignifies Boldneſſe, Liberty, &amp; War. This De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cade of the <hi>Moon</hi> ſignifies Weeping, bodily Sorrow, Fear, as if we
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:41577:43"/> ſhould ſay, that ſeeing the actions or effects of the <hi>great Conjunction</hi> ſhall be in a very great meaſure excited &amp; put in agitation from the influence of this Conjunction of the year 1663. and although from thence there is generally much good to be hoped for from the influence of <hi>Jupiter</hi> and <hi>Venus;</hi> yet ſeeing there are a ſort of people in the world, who will take the boldneſſe to plot, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trive, ſeduce, and under the pretence of Liberty, Religion, &amp;c. endeavour to raiſe Sedition, War, or ſuch kind of Rebellious Diſturbances; ſo from the influence hereof will they bring de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction to themſelves, and great Fear, Sorrow and Lamentation to others.</p>
               <p>And if the judgement of <hi>Proclus</hi> upon Eclipſes, when they happen in any, or in the ſeveral <hi>Decanats</hi> of every Sign, may be applyed to Conjunctions (which method is generally uſed by <hi>Eſcuid.)</hi> then are we further confirmed of what ſhall generally happen, <hi>viz.</hi> from the firſt Decade in which the great Conjuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on happened, is ſignified Seditions among men, many will be averſe to Peace and the accommodation of Treaties, each man fearing and finding deceit from others he deals with, nay even among Princes there will be much deluſion one of another, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the vulgar there will be many Thefts and Robberies, Cheats and Rapines; and indeed as much is ſignifyed by the <hi>Moon</hi> and <hi>Mercury</hi> in the Conjunction.</p>
               <p>From the ſecond <hi>Decanate,</hi> in which this Conjunction hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens, and in which was the New Star of the year 1604. he tells us of a Mortality, or Murrain and Deſtruction among the greater Cattel, and ſuch as are moſt uſeful for the food and ſuſtenance of Man; the Seas are extraordinarily moleſted with Pirates, as well as the Land with Thieves.</p>
               <p>From the laſt <hi>Decade</hi> (wherein the ſecond Conjunction of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn</hi> and <hi>Mars</hi> happens, which we are to conſider) <hi>Proclus</hi> tells us, that alſo ſignifies deſtruction to Horſes, and great prejudice to ſuch Armies as are then on foot; matters will go very hardly with the Nobility in many places, many of which will raſhly and wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully undo or prejudice themſelves to no purpoſe, others are very ſubtil and crafty for themſelves, averſe to the counſels of others, or very ſlow to that which is good; the Plague, and other great Evils do afflict mankind, Conſumptions abounding more than ordinary.</p>
               <pb n="75" facs="tcp:41577:43"/>
               <p>And ſeeing the accidents ſignified by this <hi>Triplicity</hi> are the moſt ſuperlative, it is worthy our notice that thoſe tranſactions are the more excited by the poſitions of other Planets, for not onely <hi>Saturn</hi> and <hi>Jupiter,</hi> but we have <hi>Mars</hi> and <hi>Venus</hi> alſo in this <hi>Triplicity</hi> poſited, applying to a Trine at the time of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction; And therefore by the 38. <hi>Propoſ.</hi> of <hi>Lud. de Reg. Quanto nobilior est Ignea triplicitas, triplicitate aquea, tanto dignior eſt aerea triplicitas, triplicitate terrea; Ideo cum videris tres planetas fortes in triplicitate ignea vel acrea, non feſtines judicium, nec idem tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das in rebus parvis, maxime ſi Sol ſit in ea triplicitate, &amp;c.</hi> By how much the <hi>Fiery Triplicity</hi> is more noble than the <hi>Watry,</hi> by ſo much is the <hi>Aiery Triplicity</hi> more worthy than the <hi>Earthly;</hi> therefore when thou ſeeſt three (or more) Planets ſtrong in theſe or either of theſe two <hi>Triplicities,</hi> be not haſty to give judgement, neither deliver the ſame in ſmall matters, eſpecially if the <hi>Sun</hi> do behold them, or be alſo therein, or two of the Superiours. This is alſo the advice of <hi>Cardane,</hi> which I mentioned before.</p>
               <p>In this Conjunction all the ſuperiour Planets, <hi>Saturn, Jupiter,</hi> and <hi>Mars,</hi> were in this <hi>Trigon, Venus</hi> in the Sign of the Conjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction it ſelf, the Full <hi>Moon</hi> preceding was in <hi>Aries,</hi> and the <hi>Sun</hi> in <hi>Libra,</hi> a Sign of the <hi>Aiery Triplicity,</hi> and the tenth of the great Conjunction; ſo that theſe are yet further teſtimonies, that not onely from the great Conjunction, but alſo from this of the year 1663. are great and ſuperlative alterations and tranſactions ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified to happen in the world, generally for this next twenty years; the particulars of which you have heard at large, among which this alſo is to be added from the poſition of the <hi>Sun</hi> in the tenth of the great Conjunction; that ſome great Perſons or Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentates of <hi>Europe,</hi> who have been much depreſſed and detrimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in their Honours and Dignities, will not onely be reſtored to their former Prerogatives, but ſhall alſo have an enlargement of their Dominion, and Honour, and Renown, from the effects of this Conjunction, though others muſt be depreſt; but in what places theſe ſhall be, I ſhall ſhew by and by.</p>
               <p>But let us conſider the <hi>fixed Stars</hi> alſo, that accompany, or do ariſe with the Planets conjoyned or configurated thereto, and have dominion therein; for ſo are we adviſed by <hi>Ptolomy,</hi> Aph. 96. <hi>Conſidera etiam naturam ſtellarum ſimul conſiſtentium, tum erra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticarum

Imitantur naturam &amp; actio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem errantium, quare illarum actiones ad eas inferunt;</hi> They do imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate the nature of the Planets and their actions, wherefore the actions of the Planets are transferred unto them. Not that theſe vertues, or ſuch like operations, are to be altogether underſtood of the Fixed Stars themſelves, but when joyned to the Planets, according to the 13 <hi>Aphoriſm</hi> of the ſame unknown Author; <hi>Stellae fixae non conjunctae planetis, multo minores effectus habent quam planetae ipſi, ſed conjuncti planetis vehementiſsimos producunt ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectus;</hi> The Fixed Stars conjoyned to the Planets, do many times produce leſſer effects than thoſe Planets, whoſe vertues they aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume; but joyned to the Planets they produce moſt vehement effects.</p>
               <p>And here I cannot but give caution in the examining of the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of thoſe Conjunctions that happened in former times; that no wonder if there hapen ſome variation of the effects, ſeeing the Conſtellations are ſince varied out of one Sign into another, cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by the retroceſſion of the <hi>Equinoxes; Multae actiones ſigno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum mutantur, pro mutatione imaginum ſtellarum iis conreſpondentium in figura.</hi> Anonim. 120. Many actions of the Signs are changed, by reaſon of the mutation of the Images of the Stars correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent in Figure to theſe Signs.</p>
               <p>And although this motion be ſlow, <hi>viz.</hi> 1 deg. and about 20
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:41577:44"/> minutes in 100 years (that is a Sign in 2250 years) yet in time the whole Signs (and in ſome ſence the Conſtellations, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of different declination) are varied; ſo that although (as I mentioned in the former part of this Treatiſe, <hi>cap.</hi> 3. of Great Conjunctions) the ſeveral reſtitutions of the Superiours ſince the Creation of the World, did happen in <hi>Sagittary,</hi> accounting their Longitude from the Vernal Equinox; yet reckoning the ſeveral Conſtellations from the Firſt Star of <hi>Aries,</hi> we ſhall find a very great variation in this Age we now live in; for the place of the Conjunction now, <hi>viz.</hi> the 14 degree of <hi>Sagittary,</hi> is about the middle of the conſtellation of <hi>Scorpio;</hi> but by computation you will find that the firſt Conjunction which happened 3950 years before Chriſt, in the 8 degree of <hi>Sagittary,</hi> was in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the conſtellation of <hi>Aquarius,</hi> and ſo from one revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution to another they recede about 10 deg. and a half. But to return to our purpoſe.</p>
               <p>The Conſtellation in which theſe Conjunctions do happen, is <hi>Scorpio,</hi> of a moſt viperous, wicked and malicious nature, falſe and deceitful, venimous and corrupt, ſo will many of the tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actions thereby ſignifyed be, or the more wholſome and bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volent influence will thereby be polluted, retarded, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſuppreſſed.</p>
               <p>The Fixed Stars that are with the Planets conjoyned in that part of the <hi>Aſteriſm,</hi> are not very eminent, becauſe of ſmall mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitude; <hi>Stellae fixae majores ſun<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

But thoſe that are near the Ecliptick in that part of the Sign and Conſtellation, are of the nature of <hi>Saturn</hi> chiefly, but partly <hi>Venus;</hi> this adds to the power of <hi>Saturn,</hi> and indeed there are many ſmall Stars of his nature near that place, ſo that <hi>Saturn</hi> will not want for Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions, Aſſociates, and Aſſiſtants (though of themſelves of leſſe repute and power) to carry on, and to connive at his ſubtilties, hypocriſies, and his private and cunning ſtratagems, whereby he would endeavour to ſuppreſſe the more benevolent intents and endeavours of the Jovialiſt, both in matters of Church and State; how many pitiful ſneaking fellows will there be, to attend and incroach into the Courts of Kings and Princes, and of Juſtice,

               <p>But with <hi>Saturn</hi> and <hi>Jupiter</hi> doth ariſe a moſt eminent Star, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Scorpions</hi> Heart, for by reaſon of its great South Latitude it riſeth in our Horizon with the 10degree of <hi>Sagittary, Saturn</hi> and <hi>Jupiter</hi> about the 12. the Star is of the nature of <hi>Mars</hi> and <hi>Jupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter;</hi> this adds to the ſtrength of <hi>Jupiter; Venus</hi> being alſo with the Star in Longitude, <hi>Mars</hi> alſo applying to the Conjunction by <hi>Trine,</hi> are of very good ſignification; <hi>Jupiter,</hi> or the Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous will ſtruggle hard with the temporal powers, and by Martial Policy, rather than Violence, will evade the malignity of <hi>Saturn, viz.</hi> of that ſubtil ſullen crew, that would pervert their Counſels and endeavours; For <hi>Mars,</hi> who ſignifies the Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, or the Military part of Kingdomes, is the moſt potent of all the Planets in the Figure, having about 27 dignities at the time of the Conjunction, and is chief diſpoſitor of both the Lunati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, <hi>viz.</hi> of the Full Moon before, and the New Moon after the Conjunction, and applying thereto by a Trine; This plainly intimates, that although he hath power to execute Violence, to conquer and deſtroy, yet will he uſe great policy and induſtry to mitigate and perſwade (for the Stars with him are of the nature of <hi>Saturn</hi> and <hi>Mars)</hi> and by reaſon of his great ſtrength will have power to prevail, and be a means to reconcile thoſe diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences and diſturbances that might otherwiſe ariſe from thoſe cunning, deceitful and Jeſuitical Factions; and although <hi>Mars</hi> performs this by direction (or under the Authority) of his Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riours, yet is it much of his own care and prudence, that will be the means thereof.

               <p>I onely add this conſideration, that as <hi>Saturn</hi> ſignifies the <hi>Countrey-man,</hi> in particular, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Farmer, Yeoman,</hi> &amp;c. he being ſo benevolently irradiated at the Conjunction by both <hi>Jupiter</hi> and <hi>Venus,</hi> gives probable teſtimony, that notwithſtanding his remote diſtance and oblique poſition from the Earth, <hi>viz.</hi> ſo neer his Aphelion, and greateſt declination Southward, ſo that he cannot project his beams ſo forcibly (as Sir <hi>Chriſtopher Heydon</hi> moſt judiciouſly obſerves, and proves by example) whence the Winter becomes more temperate and unſeaſonable; yet after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ſhall the Farmer receive great plenty of Corn generally, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept in thoſe years when <hi>Saturn</hi> rules, and is malevolently poſited and configurated; but as to other Fruits of the Earth, many times great ſcarcity.</p>

               <p>Perhaps ſome, who make a more curious ſearch, may finde out ſome other niceties from hence, but theſe are the moſt prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal; <hi>Cardane, Segm. 4.

               <p>But this we muſt obſerve, that whatſoever is ſignified by the other Planets from the former conſiderations, which do acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentally happen among themſelves, yet the grand actions of this next twenty years are principally ſignified by <hi>Saturn, Jupiter</hi> and <hi>Mars;</hi> which although he hath great power and ſtrength, yet not ſo as to ſignify much War, but rather, as was ſaid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, by a Military Poſture and Policy, keep a general peace in moſt parts of the world; the accidents of <hi>Saturn</hi> and <hi>Jupiter</hi> do ſpend themſelves in ſuperlative and ſerious conſultations, but with great variation and uncertainty, becauſe the Sign is double bodied.</p>

                  <p>The places where the Effects will moſt princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally operate.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>ALthough the conjunctions of the ſuperiour Planets have the moſt general ſignification of Mundane affairs, and are moſt univerſal in their operations (as in the firſt part of this Treatiſe I proved) yet it muſt not be expected that the effects ſhould ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate in all places alike, but (as in the judgement of the Learned) thoſe places ſubject to the Sign (eſpecially) and its Triangle or Triplicity, and the Quadrangle, with conſideration had to the ſituation of the Significators, whether to the North of the <hi>Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noctial,</hi> or to the South, ſhall be moſt ſenſible of the Effects; for undoubtedly, according to thoſe poſitions will thoſe parts of the world be paſſive in the Effects, while thoſe Conjunctions, Eclip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, or other of the Celeſtial appearances that doe happen in or neer the <hi>Equinoxes,</hi> do operate more univerſally, and have their influence; more equally diſtributed throughout the World, as well on one ſide the Equinoctial, as on the other. <hi>Daſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>podius</hi> 86.</p>
               <p>This is alſo a certain rule, that thoſe places of the world ſhall be ſubject moſt to the Celeſtial Influences, to which the Signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficators do moſt directly project their beams, <hi>viz.</hi> to which they are neereſt <hi>perpendicular,</hi> and eſpecially thoſe which are under the dominion of the Sign in which the Significators are in.</p>
               <p>Hence it is, that according to the 72 of <hi>Lud. de Reg. Thoſe Stars that have North latitude and declination, are more efficacious than thoſe of the South;</hi> For by the 55 of Doctor <hi>Dec, Quo ſtellae ejuſdem mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra ſuper horizontem major fuerit, eò ad ſuae virtutis, &amp;c.</hi> they are not only the neerer the <hi>Vertex,</hi> but a ſo make a greater <hi>Arch</hi> above the <hi>Horizon,</hi> and by how much a Star doth make the longer ſtay above the <hi>Horizon,</hi> by ſo much more is he fitted by thoſe his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect beams to make a ſtronger impreſſion of his vertue over or upon thoſe parts, and ſo on the contrary the leſſer Arch or Stay above the <hi>Horizon,</hi> the more weaker the effects in thoſe places.</p>
               <pb n="83" facs="tcp:41577:47"/>
               <p>So then, ſeeing that not onely the places particularly ſubject to the dominion of the Sign wherein the Configuration happens, and the Triplicity and Quadrangle thereto belonging, according to <hi>Ptolomy;</hi> but alſo by the 86 of <hi>Anonim. Longitudo, Latitudo, &amp; Declinatio Stellae locum ſuorum effectuum in orbe terrarum ſignificare poſſunt;</hi> The Longitude, Latitude, and Declination of a Star, may ſignify the places of their effects; Let us conſider where the moſt principal effects will manifeſt themſelves.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ptolomy</hi> attributeth <hi>Europe</hi> generally to the <hi>Fiery Trigon, Dafi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pod.

The Trigon or Triplicity of <hi>Aries, Leo, Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gittarius,</hi> is the ſignificator of, or doth moſt operate upon the Chriſtians; And by <hi>Cardane</hi> upon the <hi>Roman Empire;</hi> which if <gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>re, then by the declination of the Planets, the Southern and South-eaſt parts of <hi>Europe</hi> will be the moſt principal places de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned for the operation of the effects, according to that Maxime, <hi>Stellae quae ſeptentrionalem habent latitudinem &amp; declinationem in nos, quae verò meridionalem inhabitantes verſus meridiem efficacius agunt.</hi> Thoſe Stars which have Septentrional or North latitude, or declination, do operate moſt among us that live more Northerly, but having South declination and latitude to thoſe that inhabit more to the South, the effects are more efficacious.</p>
               <p>The declination of <hi>Saturn</hi> and <hi>Jupiter</hi> at this their conjunction, is very neer the greateſt they can be, onely having North lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude from the Ecliptick, doth diminiſh it ſomewhat, ſo that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though all places more or leſſe, will be ſubject to the effects, though in a different manner, yet without doubt thoſe places that lie South and South-eaſt will be the places where the grand effects of the Conjunction will moſt evidently and powerfully ſhew themſelves.</p>

               </p>
               <p>Theſe are the places generally attributed to this Triplicity, wherein there is ſome decrepancy among Authors, which I ſhall not trouble my ſelf or my reader with in this place; therefore, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I proceed further, let us examine what may more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly happen in thoſe places; ſeeing by the aforeſaid <hi>Aphoriſm</hi> of <hi>Daſipod.</hi> the operations of the Celeſtial Bodies are of divers natures, and thoſe as diverſly operating in different places of the world.</p>
               <p>But is <hi>Spain</hi> (eſpecially) and thoſe other Countries before mentioned, ſubject to <hi>Sagittary,</hi> wherein ſo many Conjunctions of the Planets, but eſpecially this of the Superiours happen? I believe it is, then that and thoſe Countries will be moſt highly concerned in the effects thereof, great conſultations there will be about reformation of Religion, great debates between the Spiritual and Temporal Prerogatives; and nothing but the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of the Sword of Martial policy can make peace, the Religious much dejected and depreſſed, not onely by the temporal Powers and Authority, but even by thoſe more private and hypocritical Functions, who are of religious Orders and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Jupiter</hi> is Lord of the Sign, he doth not onely ſignify the King, but the Nobility alſo; <hi>Saturn</hi> afflicts both Sign and its Lord, both King and Kingdome, with Sorrow, Fear, Lamentation, Famine, or great Scarcity; the death of many Nobles; others dejected are caſt out of their Dignities and Prerogatives, and others more baſe and fordid, by craft and ſubtilty, exalted there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, and pretending thereto by right from Antiquity.</p>
               <p>The King of <hi>Spain</hi> hath <hi>Sagittary</hi> aſcending at his Nativity, this Conjunction and thoſe of <hi>Saturn</hi> and <hi>Mars</hi> happening there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, will undoubtedly produce very croſs tranſactions in his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſultations, produce death or detriment to his health ere the year 1666. be expired; which if he ſhould die, there would be vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous contentions and differences about the propriety to the Crown beyond expectation; certainly as great are the conſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, ſo will great be the afflictions and ſorrows of that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:41577:48"/> and thoſe other Kingdomes ſubject thereto, during the effects of the Conjunction, but more eſpecially in the years 1644. 65, and part of 66. For beſides the malevolent Conjunction of <hi>Saturn</hi> and <hi>Mars,</hi> that happens the latter end of the year 64. it is not to be neglected, that the Planet <hi>Mars</hi> comes by direction from his place at the great Conjunction 1603. to the degree of the ſaid Conjunction, about thoſe years, which undoubtedly will produce very notable events in the world, but eſpecially in thoſe places ſubject to the dominion of the Sign.</p>
               <p>And ſeeing the accidents hereby ſignified (that is of the whole configuration of Heaven) muſt eſpecially be of the nature of this Sign, becauſe it is the place of the ſeveral conjunctions of the Planets, we are therefore to note, that as it is of the regal and moſt noble Triplicity, ſo are the moſt eminent perſons of thoſe places concerned therein, eſpecially with whoſe Nativities the Conjunction or Conjunctions of the ſuperiour Planets are concomitant.</p>
               <p>Therefore not onely in thoſe places (forenamed) under the rule and dominion of the Sign (of which <hi>Spain</hi> is chief, ſo alſo <hi>Hungaria)</hi> but alſo in other places, according to the quality of the effects, there to be manifeſted, this generally is to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, <hi>viz.</hi>

               <p>That thoſe eminent perſons who have the Sign <hi>Sagittary</hi> aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cending at their Nativity, or of that Trigon, and neer the degree of the conjunction of <hi>Saturn</hi> and <hi>Jupiter,</hi> or of the New Star, thoſe perſons will be the moſt active in carrying on the affairs of thoſe places; to the great good and ſatisfaction of the people thereof, and alſo greatly to their own advantage; but if the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of their Aſcendent be neerer to the conjunctions of <hi>Saturn</hi> and <hi>Mars,</hi> or in Square or Oppoſition thereto, it portends great detriment to them, both as to the health of their bodies, great contentions, and other croſſe tranſactions in their affairs; ſo likewiſe if it have the ſame reſpect to the place of the <hi>Moon</hi> at the time of their birth, and withall to thoſe it portends much damage in publick matters, that is, to thoſe that are in ſuch em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments or offices in thoſe Kingdomes or places ſignified by this Sign.</p>
               <p>Is there any great perſon who hath his <hi>Medium Coeli,</hi> or place
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:41577:49"/> of the Sun, in or neer the place of the great Conjunction or new Star, or our preſent Conjunction? thoſe perſons (without the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignity of the Infortunes) ſhall receive great Honour and Digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, be very famous for heroick actions, and attain to moſt emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent repute and eſtimation in the world, by reaſon of their great Prudence, grave and wiſe Counſels, great Learning and Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; but on the contrary, if it happen in Square or Oppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <note place="margin">☞</note> thereto, the contrary happens—Depoſition, Infamy and Diſgrace (though their actions be never ſo wiſe and prudent) various contentions with Noble men, much detriment and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction in Affairs, and if it happen to be neer the place of the conjunctions of <hi>Saturn</hi> and <hi>Mars,</hi> it portends great danger of a violent death, or the more hurtful accidents to thoſe perſons, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in Life or Fortune.</p>
               <p>But if it happen neer the part of Fortune, or ſecond Houſe, or place of <hi>Jupiter,</hi> or other ſignificators of the ſubſtance or Fortune of any perſon (eſpecially I ſay of ſuch perſons as are of eminen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and concerned in the affaires of thoſe Kingdomes and pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces where they inhabit, to them it prenotes an addition of rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es and fortune, &amp;c. <hi>Et ſic è contra.)</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe are the perſons particularly concerned in the effects of theſe eminent Configurations; thoſe that are ſtudious in this Science, do know this to be a general truth, being ſufficiently warranted by the authority of the Learned herein. Thus <hi>Junctine de Eclipſibus,</hi> pag. 307. which we may alſo apply to greater or leſſer conjunctions of the Planets; his words are, <hi>That thoſe Eclipſes (or malevolent Conjunctions of the Planets) that do happen in or neer the Horoſcope, or other principal places of the Nativity, do portend ſome eminent evil, either to the body or vital ſubſtance, or plunged into many misfortunes, which cannot be avoided without great difficulty; and if other malevolent Configurations at the Birth do alſo concur, or ſome bad direction at that time, many times Death or violent Caſualties do happen.</hi> But as to the Conjunctions of <hi>Saturn</hi> and <hi>Jupiter,</hi> we muſt obſerve this diſtinction, that when they happen in thoſe eminent places of the Radical Figure, they portend good (ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept prevented or diminiſhed by ſome malevolent rayes therein) or ſome contrary direction or revolution; but if in Square or Oppoſition thereto, evil is ſignified, but in a different manner to
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:41577:49"/> different perſons, and the variety of the ſignifications at the birth.</p>
               <p>And this alſo is worth our notice, that thoſe perſons who are thus concerned in the effects, if <hi>Saturn</hi> ſhall be Lord of any of their Genitures, or have moſt dominion therein, thoſe perſons will be very active to put forward the influence of <hi>Saturn</hi> in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction, <hi>viz.</hi> will act very politickly, privately, cunningly, &amp;c. and ſo on the other ſide thoſe who are ſignified by <hi>Jupiter,</hi> will ſuffer and be ſuppreſſed, however will act very wiſely, prudently, faithfully, and zealouſly, both in matter politick and Eccleſiaſtick.</p>
               <p>Theſe things I ſay are generally known to the more judicious, though not ſufficiently conſidered by all; and thoſe that either have (or may have) their Nativities carefully rectified, and that without wreſting, (of which too many profeſſors are guilty) may hereby ſee how much they are concerned in this or any other Configuration of Heaven; For my own part I ſhall not preſume to meddle or take any publick notice of any Nativity whatſoever of our Engliſh Worthies; what I am otherwiſe or more privately employed to do, I ſhall be faithful therein; ſome there are, I am very ſure, that are highly concerned in the effects hereof. But enough of this.</p>
               <p>There are yet other places ſubject to the Influence hereof, beſides <note place="margin">England.</note> what are under the dominion of this Sign, as you may perceive by what is mentioned before: For under <hi>Aries</hi> all Authors ſay is <hi>England, France, Germany,</hi> &amp;c. if ſo, <hi>Mars</hi> is the moſt potent Planet in the Figure in Trine to his own Houſe, the Sign of the Conjunction is alſo of the <hi>Trigon</hi> Arguments of the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and fortitude of theſe places againſt all Forein or Domeſtick Adverſaries or Diſturbances; this ſhews in what an excellent Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary poſture we ſhall generally be in for the preſervation of our ſelves and our friends, from or againſt all Inſurrections and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellions, ſudden Commotions, Tumults, or other ſeditious Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiracies, that may caſually happen. And indeed if <hi>Gemini</hi> be the Aſcendent of <hi>LONDON,</hi> which is the Metropolis of <hi>England,</hi> and alſo part of the Nation according to ſome, the unhappy poſItion of the <hi>Moon</hi> therein, and of <hi>Mercury</hi> her diſpoſitor, doth evidently denote that there will happen ſuch Enormities therein,
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:41577:50"/> greatly to the prejudice of the Contrivers and the Fomenters thereof.</p>
               <p>And indeed, were it not for theſe or-ſuch like miſchiefs, that ever and anon will break forth, from the exaſperated ſpirits of a ſeditious multitude; this Conjunction of it ſelf portends in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral great Tranquillity to the Kingdome of <hi>England;</hi> for ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that prepoſterous Conjunction of <hi>Saturn</hi> and <hi>Jupiter, Anno</hi> 1642/3. did in a large manner excite, put forward &amp; augment theſe Commotions, Rebellions, and by all manner of violence and illegal practiſes, ſuppreſſe and ſubvert all former Laws and Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomes, Governments, Rights and Privileges, &amp;c. ſo now from this reſtitution of the Superiours into this Trigon again, and more eſpecially as it is the ſame Sign, in which the great Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction and the New ſtar the following year happened, may ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionally be conjectured, not onely the aboliſhing of all thoſe exorbitant abuſes both in Church and State, and all former Rights, Cuſtomes and Privileges reſtored and firmly eſtabliſhed, yea even many of thoſe who have been ſtiff oppoſers thereof, ſhall be reconciled and become conformable thereto, and the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, becauſe there will be much endeavour uſed for the corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the abuſes of Laws and Religion; theſe were general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly mentioned before, but now particularly applied to this our Kingdome and Nation of <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We are now at the time of this Conjunction, through the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence of God, at peace with all Nations, I think, in the world, and indeed, generally are like ſo to be, nor can any forein Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary attain any victory or advantage over us, ſhould they attempt it; No, the Kingdome of <hi>England</hi> for this next twenty years eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially, will continue in great honour and glory, great Peace and Tranquillity (except ſome home-bred differences and diſturban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, which (I hope) will not continue long:) Nay, it ſeems pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable to me, that <hi>England</hi> and thoſe other places under the domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of the Sign <hi>Aries</hi> ſhall be very inſtrumental, either by Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial power or policy, to put a period to the Enormities and Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences that either are or ſhall be among other Nations; in which ſome by very eminent heroick attempts attain to very great ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and dignity, or do in a large meaſure excel others, both in action and renown.</p>
               <pb n="89" facs="tcp:41577:50"/>
               <p>Thus much as to the National affairs in general, from the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of the Conjunction it ſelf, or from its proper Significators; but as to matters Phyſical, or from the natural Effects, give me leave to add what (indeed) is already mentioned, <hi>viz.</hi> that ſeeing af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter thoſe preceding Conjunctions of <hi>Saturn</hi> &amp; <hi>Jupiter</hi> in the <hi>Fiery Trigon</hi> there hath happened great Plagues in <hi>England,</hi> as in the year 1605. and 1625. ſo may we fear the like to happen amongſt us, either in the year 1664. or rather, and more eſpecially in the year 1665. by reaſon of the malevolent Conjunction of <hi>Saturn</hi> and <hi>Mars</hi> in the latter end of the year 1664. which will operate moſt forcibly in the following year; and ſome there are who have with good reaſon conjectured, that ſeeing after the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction of the Planets in this <hi>Trigon,</hi> uſually ſome Comet or New Star hath conſequently happened, as the more notable <hi>Prodromus</hi> of thoſe eminent accidents to ſucceed, ſo is it concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved that ſome ſuch may ere long be expected to be viſible to the inhabitants of ſome parts of the Earth, whereby thoſe accidents ſignified by this and the other conjunctions of the Planets, may be more evidently preſignified and foreſeen, and that thereby the future purpoſe and will of the <hi>Almighty</hi> may take more impreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on upon the hearts of the ſons of men.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>France,</hi> which now is not generally at variance, or in any actual hoſtility with none, (except the preſent <hi>Pope)</hi> is alſo promiſed well from this Conjunction, <hi>viz.</hi> that they will alwayes be in an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent poſture of defence, and ſufficiently capable of maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their dignity and prerogative againſt all oppoſers; but gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally Peace and Tranquillity is promiſed that Nation for theſe next twenty years; nor will that difference that now is between the King and Pope, long continue, without reconciliation, yet with ſome reſtrictions and amendments, greatly to the honour and benefit of the Kingdome, and ſatisfaction of the French Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Germany,</hi> and the whole Empire, now much threatned, and in great danger of the Turk, ere long will be delivered from that Egyptian or Babyloniſh Cruelty, hower they may ſuffer and be in great fear of deſolation and deſtruction at preſent, and may be ſo for a time; the power of <hi>Mars</hi> is ſuch, and ſo friendly in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral to thoſe people and Countreys, that either by the power, po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy,
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:41577:51"/> or treaties of ſome Chriſtian Princes, it may be hoped that ere the year 1664. be expited, all or the greateſt part of that fear will be diminiſhed, if not wholly extirpated, though ſome Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treys that are under the dominion of the other Signs more unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate, will ſuffer more than ordinary.</p>
               <p>For <hi>Hungaria</hi> is under the dominion of <hi>Sagittary,</hi> where hath already been a malevolent Conjunction of <hi>Saturn</hi> and <hi>Mars,</hi> and another to ſucceed in the ſame Sign, before the Conjunction of <hi>Saturn</hi> and <hi>Jupiter</hi> will forcibly manifeſt themſelves; <hi>Zealand, Pruſſia, &amp;c.</hi> are under <hi>Cancer,</hi> and the <hi>Moon</hi> is afflicted.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Bohemia</hi> is under <hi>Leo,</hi> which Sign is ſorely afflicted by <hi>Mars, viz.</hi> Wars, Fires, Plague, and ſuch like evils of the nature of <hi>Mars.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Auſtria</hi> is under <hi>Libra,</hi> and <hi>Venus</hi> is going retrograde before ſhe comes to the conjunction of <hi>Saturn</hi> and <hi>Jupiter,</hi> or the Trine of <hi>Mars,</hi> and ſo other Countries and places of the Emperours Dominions, lying under the Juriſdiction or Dominion of other Signs, muſt accordingly expect to be ſenſible of the effects ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by the diſpoſition of their proper ſignificators.</p>
               <p>Under <hi>Leo</hi> (as was noted before) it ſeems are <hi>Italy</hi> in general, <hi>Rome</hi> in particular, <hi>Sicilia, Bohemia,</hi> part of <hi>Turky,</hi> the city of <hi>Prague, Syracuſe; Mars</hi> I ſay afflicts that Sign, and the <hi>Sun,</hi> who is ruler thereof is in his Fall; therefore to thoſe places are great calamities threatned by Fire, the Sword, Uproars, Tumults, Murthers, grievous Contentions and Quarrellings, depoſition of many Nobles, Princes and Rulers, from their Honours and Dignities, without hope of reſtitution, Death and Deſtruction to others; <hi>ROME,</hi> many or moſt of theſe Enormities are threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned thee; if peace be not ſpeedily concluded with the French King, great detriment is thereby threatened.</p>
               <p>But beſides the <hi>Triplicity</hi> we are to obſerve thoſe places alſo ſubject to the <hi>Quadrangle,</hi> for to determine the places of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents, <hi>viz.</hi> of <hi>Gemini, Virgo</hi> and <hi>Piſces, Gemini</hi> is the the Sign op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite to the Conjunction, in which the <hi>Moon</hi> is, and very weak; and under this Sign is part of <hi>Flanders, Brabant,</hi> the Dukedome of <hi>Wittenburg,</hi> the Cities of <hi>Noremberg, Corduba</hi> in <hi>Spain, Turin, Bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges</hi> in <hi>Flanders, Mentz, Kitzing, Hasford, Bamberg,</hi> and divers others; <hi>Mercury</hi> you have heard is very much depreſſed and affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted by the Square of <hi>Mars;</hi> ſo muſt all thoſe places be, ſome with
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:41577:51"/> Tumults and Inſurrections; notorious Robberies and Cheats; the common people in many places are diſſatisfied, the Merchants and Tradeſmen ſuffer great loſſe by Piracies and Thieves.</p>
               <p>Under <hi>Virgo</hi> is <hi>Achaia, Greece, Athens, Meſopotania, Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon, Aſſyria,</hi> part of <hi>Rhyne, Sileſia</hi> the lower: of Cities, <hi>Jeruſalem, Rhodes, Novarr</hi> in <hi>Italy, Paris, Lyons, Baſil, Heydleberg, Erphord:</hi> theſe are alſo under the dominion of the unfortunate <hi>Mercury,</hi> and muſt therefore expect to meet with ſuch like misfortunes as are of his nature, which was mentioned before; among which <hi>Paris</hi> is like to ſuffer much by moſt notorious Fraud, Cheats, Mutinies, Tumults, and moſt horrid Villanies, ſecret Conſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Under <hi>Piſces</hi> are <hi>Portugal, Normandy, Cilicia, Galitia, Lydia, Pamphilia, Egypt</hi> the higher, <hi>Alexandria, Compostella, Rhemes, Wormes, Ratisbone; Jupiter</hi> is Lord of this Sign, and <hi>Venus</hi> hath alſo exaltation therein, this promiſeth well generally to thoſe places, <hi>viz.</hi> a general peace, yet ſome new Monarchy or Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, or alteration of Laws and Cuſtomes, is alſo ſignified, and theſe more juſt and profitable to the people of thoſe Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons than thoſe they enjoyed before, or are more to their ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction; Chriſtian Religion in thoſe places where it is profeſſed, is more zealouſly practiſed, there will be many corrections and amendments therein, many ſuperſtitions Ceremonies aboliſhed, and a propagation or an increaſe of the knowledge of the Chriſtian Religion in thoſe places where it is yet ſcarcely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun.</p>
               <p>But we are yet further to conſider the Signs that are either af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted by the Infortunes, and wherein the Planets are, or that are ſubject to the rule or dominion of the Planets; for accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as thoſe are well or ill dignified, ſo will the Event be in thoſe places ſubject to the Signs; And this is the Doctrine ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally and more plainly laid down in the <hi>Proph. Merl.</hi> pag. 90. than elſewhere I can find.</p>
               <p>I conceive it moſt rational (ſaith the Author) Firſt, to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Sign of the Conjunction; 2. The Angles of the Figure (if it can be obtained;) 3. The Signs afflicted by the preſence of any of the Infortunes; 4. Thoſe places of Heaven the Conjuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on caſteth its Trine, Square, and oppoſite Aſpects to; 5. The
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:41577:52"/> Lords of thoſe Signs and Quarters of Heaven they are in; And 6. Whether they are ſtrong or weak?</p>
               <p>According to which rule I judge, that as <hi>Cancer</hi> is the Aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent of <hi>Scotland,</hi> ſo alſo of <hi>Holland,</hi> and that the <hi>Moon</hi> is weak, but in oppoſition to the Conjunction; there will much diſcontent and ſorrow happen to many of the common people there, various murmurings and repinings, a giddy multitude unſatisfied, and endeavouring to oppoſe the conſultations of their Superiours; But let me tell you, be not tumultuous, or endeavour to raiſe Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, nor ſtrive to oppoſe the Reſolves of your Superiours, leſt you bring great Damage, if not Deſtruction upon your ſelves; verily it may juſtly be expected that ſome ſecret Conſpiracies will be contriving and agitating in the Northern and north W. parts from <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thoſe other places ſubject to this Sign muſt alſo be paſſive in the Effects hereof, though in a different manner in ſeveral places; and they are, <hi>Holland</hi> (who I doubt will produce their own ruine by their obſtinacy, breach of Peace and Articles) <hi>Zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, Pruſia,</hi> part of <hi>Burgundy, Conſtantinople, Tunis, Venice, Genoa, Lucas, Millan, York</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> S. <hi>Andrews</hi> in <hi>Scotland, Lubeck, Wittenburgh, Corlitz, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Next let us conſider <hi>Saturn;</hi> under <hi>Aquarius</hi> is the South part of <hi>Swethland,</hi> part of <hi>Denmark, Weſtphalia;</hi> of Cities <hi>Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borough, Breme, Satzburgh, Ingoldſlade, &amp;c. Mars</hi> afflicts this Sign by oppoſition, cauſing ſome Domeſtick broyls among them, various Strifes and Contentions, whence proceed Duels, Murthers, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>But nevertheleſſe, <hi>Saturn</hi> being ſo aſſiſted by the benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent beams of the Fortunes, and the Conjunction being in <hi>Sextile</hi> thereto, promiſeth well generally as to the affairs of thoſe places, ſome matters of very high and ſuperlative concernment is ſignifyed to be acted therein, the Merchants and Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders thereof finde good trading and returnes of their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities; <hi>Tartaria</hi> the great, <hi>Wallachia, Muſcovia</hi> alſo are ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to the dominion of this Sign, and accordingly will ſhare in the like effects.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Norway</hi> is under <hi>Scorpio</hi> the other houſe of <hi>Mars,</hi> where <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury</hi> is unhappily poſited, and <hi>Mars</hi> himſelf caſting his Square
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:41577:52"/> thereto, the New Moon following being alſo in that very Sign, the Moon next applying to the Quartile of <hi>Mars,</hi> ſhewing the great misfortunes theſe people are likely to endure by War, Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roars, Rumours, Tumults, Shipwrack, and the like; yet <hi>Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark</hi> generally will be free from moleſtations, and matters there very highly carried on.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Taurus</hi> the oppoſite Sign is the Aſcendent of <hi>Ireland, Poland,</hi> the North part of <hi>Swethland; Mars</hi> is in ſquare to this, and <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury</hi> in oppoſition; nor can <hi>Venus</hi> help much, onely being ſo neer the place of the Conjunction of the year 1603. the firſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance of the ſuperiours into the Fiery Trigon, may prenote the reſtoring of former Rights and Inheritances to the people; but withall there is portended ſome notable diſturbences and Commotions, Plots and Conſpiracies to break forth from thence, to great miſchief, if not prevented.</p>
               <p>Let it not be objected, that becauſe I ſaid the Conjunction doth chiefly extend its influence to the more Southern and South<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſt part of the world from <hi>England;</hi> why I mention ſome places more North; for ſeeing the influence of the conjunctions (both greater and leſſer) of the Planets, eſpecially of <hi>Saturn</hi> and <hi>Jupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> do more or leſſe operate upon all places (though differently, according to the nature of the object or matter they are to work upon) but more eſpecially upon thoſe ſubject to the dominion of the Sign, whilſt Eclipſes, Comets, and ſuch like prodigious appearances, do chiefly manifeſt themſelves in thoſe places to which they are viſible: Therefore we may with good reaſon judge thoſe places to have ſhare in the effects; and beſides the reaſons in Art therefore given, this is further and more eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally to be added, <hi>viz.</hi> that the effects are varied (both in Quality, Place, and Time) according to the difference of Meridians, and the elevation of the Pole; according to that of <hi>Cardan<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

               <p>For example, the conjunction of <hi>Saturn</hi> and <hi>Jupiter</hi> we now
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:41577:53"/> treat of, happened with us in <hi>England</hi> and ſome other adjacent places, not onely under the Earth, which ſignifies an obſcurity of the effects, or that they may be retarded for a time, but being in and neer the Fifth Houſe of the Revolution, and the New <hi>Moon</hi> following the Conjunction it ſelf, may ſignify to us and thoſe places many abortive Births, and ſome more than ordinary monſtrous Productions, and that there ſhould be many Treaties, Embaſſies and Meſſages of Peace; all which are ſignified by the Fifth Houſe; but to thoſe places that lie more Weſterly, the Conjunction may fall in the Sixth, which ſignifyes many Infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities and Diſeaſes, to others in the Seventh, betokening Wars, &amp;c. And ſo on the other ſide to thoſe places of the world that ly far Eaſtward, whether to the elevation or depreſſion of the Pole, thoſe places may have it in their third, ſecond, or in the Aſcendent it ſelf, <hi>Et ſic de caeteris;</hi> by which it appears how in all reſpects the effects are or may be varied; but to enlarge upon this is too great a task; let what hath been ſaid in this Chapter ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice for the <hi>Places,</hi> and alſo in general the <hi>Perſons</hi> concerned in the <hi>Effects.</hi>

               <p>It hath been already mentioned, that ſeeing they are occiden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal of the Sun, and veſpertine, can onely be ſeen in the evening, and that in the occidental part of Heaven, and that at the Luna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions both before and after, as alſo at the Revolution of the year, the Conjunction was ſubterranean, thereby ſignifying an obſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the Effects, and that many things will not manifeſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves till the latter part of time determined for the influence thereof, according to that of <hi>Almanſor Propoſ. 30. Cum planetae ponderoſi fuerint occidentales à ſole dabunt probitatem circa finem vitae &amp; è converſo;</hi> when the ponderous Planets are occidental of the Sun, they give proof, or do manifeſt their effects in the end or latter part of life: this is proper to Nativities eſpecially; but as to the general influences it prenotes, that in the latter part of time alotted for their operating, the grand Events ſhall manifeſt themſelves to the world, matters being for a long time kept in great obſcurity.</p>
               <p>But for the diſcovery of the more particular year or years, wherein eminent tranſactions will fall out, the Rule laid down by <hi>Ptolomy</hi> is this, <hi>Conjunctionis locum, quo in loco ab anni aſcendente eſt, inspice, ſiquidem cum profectio illuc pervenerit tunc eventus erit.</hi> Behold the place in which the Conjunction happens from the Aſcendent of the year in which it is; for when the profecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on comes thither, then ſhall the event be; ſo alſo ſaith <hi>Almanſ.</hi> in his 82 <hi>Propoſ.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The accidents or impediments that are to happen, will ſhew them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in the years of profection, when the year of the World comes to the bodies of the malevolents; give (ſaith he) to every Sign one year.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is the general judgement of all or moſt of the <hi>Ancients,</hi> (which I ſhall not ſtand to repeat, but refer you to the 95. page of <hi>Merl. Prophet.)</hi> which Doctrine remains very dubious, and that for theſe reaſons, which I muſt alſo give caution of, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I proceed any farther.</p>
               <p>Firſt, Profections of themſelves, as they are generally taken,
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:41577:54"/> are not ſufficiently demonſtrative; for all Influences depending upon the harmony of ſome real Motion, this of Profection being not grounded (ſufficiently) upon any, is therefore not unfitly queſtioned by ſome, and they the moſt judicious in Aſtronomy now living; yet not ſo, but that it may relate to ſomething more rational, if underſtood: For (as I have ſometimes had it from my ingenious friend Mr. <hi>Thomas Street)</hi> as <hi>Directions</hi> are the Harmony of the <hi>Earths Annual</hi> &amp; Diurnal Revolutions about the <hi>Sun,</hi> ſo Profections (if any thing) are the Harmony of the <hi>Moons Diurnal</hi> and <hi>Menſurnal</hi> Revolutions about the <hi>Earth,</hi> and therefore more properly called <hi>Lunar Directions;</hi> but as in Directions founded upon theſe proportions, there is a great diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crepancy from that method commonly uſed; ſo alſo is there in this kind of Profection; but I forbear further mention hereof in this place, and leave it to the conſideration of the judicious, <hi>Qui capiat,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>But ſecondly, another reaſon is taken from the difference of the Aſcendents of revolutional Figures; for if they vary a ſign from the truth, it cauſeth at leaſt a year errour in time; and it is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent that ſome Theories differ more than a ſign one from ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, eſpecially when it happens to be among thoſe ſignes that are of more oblique (or ſhort) aſcenſions; ſo that were there certainty in proportioning the times by profection, yet the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainty, or at leaſt the diſcrepancy among Authors about the true Aſcendent of the revolutional Figures, leaves the matter in doubt.</p>
               <p>But becauſe I would not be thought too critical, the rather ſeeing there are yet very judicious Artiſts that do not altogether relinquiſh this doctrine of Profections, let us examine in what time we may expect the Effects of our Conjunction to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt themſelves.</p>
               <p>The Aſcendent of the Revolution for this year 1663. is the 23. degree of <hi>Leo</hi> (by the <hi>Caroline Tables,</hi> which by a general conſent of Obſervations is without doubt very neer the truth) the place of the Conjunction is in the 14 degree of <hi>Sagittary;</hi> the diſtance is 3 ſignes 21 degrees, which being added to the time of the Conjunction <hi>October</hi> the 10th. 1663. <hi>viz.</hi> three years and two third parts, directs to the year 1667. about the middle of the
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:41577:54"/> year, wherein, according to this proportion, very ſuperlative tranſactions muſt happen and appear upon the Stage of the World, in thoſe places ſubject to the Sign <hi>Sagittary,</hi> very great counſels and conſultations both in matters Politick and Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical.</p>
               <p>But if then matters do begin to manifeſt themſelves more publickly, or many things then come to light that before were obſcured, why ſhall not there be ſome more glorious actions, or ſome illuſtrious accidents to fall out, when by the ſame pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion the <hi>Medium Coeli</hi> comes to the place of the Conjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and conſequently its Oppoſition?</p>
               <p>The place of the <hi>Med. Coel.</hi> or the degree culminating in the Meridian of <hi>London</hi> is the 9th. degree of <hi>Taurus;</hi> one ſign and about 5 degr. which gives in this meaſure of time one year and two moneths, <hi>viz.</hi> the latter end of the year 1664. at what time the mid-Heaven comes to the Oppoſition of the Conjunction; ſo that let us obſerve, if about that time we hear of ſome notable contentions and ſtruglings among ſome Grandees and moſt eminent perſons in the world, about ſome ancient Rights or Cuſtomes, &amp;c. This muſt be underſtood to happen at that time with us in <hi>England,</hi> for in thoſe places where the Meridian and elevation of the Pole is varied, the time accordingly is varied, which is alſo another reaſon of the ſcruple that may be made of this kind of meaſure of time, <hi>viz.</hi> becauſe it cannot be univerſal, as other Rules and Directions are.</p>
               <p>But if we alſo direct the Aſcendent to other Planets in this manner, we may find that the Aſcendent comes to the body of the <hi>Sun,</hi> about the latter end of the year 1665. which may alſo diſcover ſomething of moment to the world, becauſe the <hi>Sun</hi> was lately in <hi>Sextile</hi> to the Planets conjoyned; perhaps there appears ſome eminent perſon that would by policy and intreaty effect ſomething to the compoſing of differences; but attempting and being willing to do more than he hath power to effect, falls of himſelf into ſome ignominy and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace. The <hi>Medium Coeli</hi> comes to the Conjunction, and to the Oppoſition of the <hi>Moon,</hi> towards the latter end of the year
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:41577:55"/> 1670. or the beginning of 1671. which accordingly muſt produce the effects thereof in a moſt illuſtrious manner, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the influence of the Conjunction is then almoſt at the higheſt.</p>
               <p>For this is obſervable in Conjunctions (and alſo agreeable to <note place="margin">Nota.</note> the precepts of <hi>Ptolomy</hi> upon Eclipſes) that the effects thereof do increaſe till they come to Oppoſition, which is about the middle of the time determined for the continuance of the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects, from one Conjunction to another, and after by degrees they decreaſe, or do operate more remiſly, till excited again by the influence of another Conjunction, or remitted by ſome contrary Configurations.</p>
               <p>This is to be underſtood of leſſer Conjunctions, but may al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo be applied, and is as conſiderable in the effects of greater and mean Conjunctions, whoſe effects do laſt in general neer two hundred years, whileſt thoſe that are called leſſer Conjuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which happen every twenty yeares in ſigns of the ſame Triplicity, do accordingly intend or remit, increaſe or dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh, or do more particularly ſhew the times of the effects ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified by thoſe more eminent Configurations.</p>
               <p>Our Conjunction (as I formerly mentioned) cannot pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly be ſaid to be great, being not the firſt entrance into the <hi>Fiery Trigon;</hi> yet as it may be termed the reſtitution therof (by reaſon of that prepoſterous Conjunction of the year 1643.) the effects thereon depending muſt be the more eminent, or of the nature of a Mean Conjunction; and this the rather, becauſe it is the fourth Conjunction ſince their entrance into this <hi>Trigon,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Nota.</note> which falling alwayes in the ſame Sign with the firſt Conjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and the effects thereof increaſing, <hi>viz.</hi> in the firſt hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred years, is therefore (I ſay) the more forcible in exciting and manifeſting the effects of the great Conjunction it ſelf for the next ſucceeding twenty years; foraſmuch alſo, as all the Planets come then to a Sextile of their own places; the like is to be underſtood of the mean Conjunctions.</p>
               <p>But for the intentions or remiſſion of the effects by the Aſpects (which was the firſt conſideration in this digreſſion) I ſhall have occaſion to handle afterwards, theſe I thought ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to premiſe.</p>
               <pb n="99" facs="tcp:41577:55"/>
               <p>There are yet other wayes more ſafe (becauſe more demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrative) and more neceſſary (becauſe univerſal) to all parties (though differently) of the world; and theſe are Directions, Tranſits, leſſer Conjunctions and Aſpects of the Planets (eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially of the Superiours) alſo Eclipſes of the Luminaries, and what other configurations or appearances there may happen concomitant: Theſe do moſt certainly ſhew the particular times of the events; all which, as may be moſt neceſſary, I ſhall handle, not troubling my ſelf or my Reader with niceties, or too many curioſities; ſuch as are ſtudious may wade further if they pleaſe.</p>
               <p>Theſe in themſelves are not onely demonſtrative and moſt rationally to be obſerved, but it is alſo the judgement of the ancient and modern Aſtrologians, as by theſe notable precepts will appear.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Non ſolum per revolutiones annorum civitatis vel mundi, aut ſectae cognitionem futurorum habueris, oportet enim directiones ipſorum principiorum conſiderare.</hi> Not onely by the revolutions of the years of the World, or of a City, or of a Sect, may'ſt thou have the knowledge of future events; but it behoveth thee alſo to conſider the directions of thoſe Radixes or begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings. <hi>Ludov. de Rig.

In great Conjunctions uſe directions, that thou maiſt know the times of the grand Mutations of Cities and Countreys; ſo al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo in the 293 <hi>Aph.</hi> of the ſame Author, he adviſeth us to uſe Directions (yea, and Profections too) in the beginning of Sects, that we may know the accidents attending, which is alſo to be underſtood in all other <hi>Radixes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The very ſame rule is preſcribed in the 53 <hi>Aphor.</hi> of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther unknown Author; <hi>In maximis conjunctionibus &amp; in nativi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>urbium,
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:41577:56"/> &amp; provinciarum, &amp; gentium, utere directionibus pro inveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>endo tempore eventuum;</hi> In great or the greateſt Conjunctions, and in the Nativities of Cities, Provinces, or People, or Sect, uſe directions for the finding of the time of the events.</p>
               <p>But a more general and ſpecial Rule is laid down in 52 <hi>Aph. Eventus magnae conjunctionis ad actum reducuntur, quando atmuten ejus pervenerit ad ſuam domum vel exaltationem, vel ab angulo fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gurae conjunctionis redierint ad aspectum, vel quando conſtellatio E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clipſis, vel annuae revolutionis ſimilis fuerit ſignificationis.</hi> The events of a great Conjunction are reduced to action, when the chief ſignificator thereof comes by direction to his own houſe, or exaltation, or when they are taken from an Angle of the Figure to an Aſpect, or when the Conſtellation of an Eclipſe, or annual Revolution, ſhall be of like ſignifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>Many more <hi>Aphoriſms</hi> might be produced to this purpoſe; but I muſt haſten: What hath been ſaid of Directions, is alſo as true in Aſpects and other Configurations, according to that of <hi>Cardane, Non ſolum conjunctiones verum etiam oppoſitiones &amp; quadrati radii ſuperiorum planetarum magnas in mundo mutationes deſignant.</hi> Not onely the Conjunctions, but alſo the Quadrat and oppoſite Rayes, or Aſpects of the ſuperiour Planets <hi>(No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta,</hi> the Aſpects or Conjunctions of the Inferiours are little ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificant, <hi>de minimis non curamus)</hi> do produce great mutations in the world, not that they enforce any thing contrary to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence of the Conjunction, but being ſubordinate thereto, do ſhew the times of the events. For by the 8 <hi>Propoſ.</hi> of <hi>Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes, Aspectus non poteſt diminuere ſignificationem conjunctionis, nam conjunctio fortitor eſt aſpectu.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As for the method uſed in Directions, I ſhall wholly adhere to <hi>Kepler,</hi> who directs all the Planets in the Ecliptick, allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the motion of a day for a year, which as in it ſelf it hath been ſufficiently proved to be more harmonious, true and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrative, ſo in this caſe is it alone to be admitted, ſince for the reaſons already given, we cannot attain the true figure of the Conjunction, ſo as to take the circles of Poſition to direct in the Equator.</p>
               <pb n="101" facs="tcp:41577:56"/>
               <p>And ſeeing, as hath been ſaid, that in our judgements we are to take in the great Conjunction, and the new Star of the years 1603 and 1604. I muſt therefore begin with thoſe, and ſee what directions of any moment do fall within the limits of our preſent Conjunction. As for the Comet in fifty two, no cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain directions can be gathered from thence, becauſe of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainty of its firſt appearance; and beſides the influence pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly of it ſelf is diminiſhing, although ſomething may now and then break forth.</p>
               <p>The firſt Direction obſervable is that about the year 1663. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1663"/> or 1664. even neer the time, or at leaſt within the year which this Conjunction happens, do the conjoyned Planets come to a Sextile of their own places, <hi>viz.</hi> to the place of the Conjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction; and conſequently all the other Planets; ſo that from hence it may be hoped there may be great inclinations and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours to compoſe differences, eſpecially ſuch as have been formerly or not lately broached or begun; and who knows but the effects of <hi>Mars</hi> his Trine to the Conjunction, may produce much to that purpoſe about the time of the Vernal In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſe 1664?</p>
               <p>For about that time the <hi>Sun</hi> in the great Conjunction comes <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1664"/> alſo to a Sextile of <hi>Venus</hi> in the 26 deg. 3/2 of <hi>Aquarius,</hi> not far from a Trine of the <hi>M. C.</hi> thereof; the Sun ſignifies Kings, Emperours, and great men; <hi>Venus</hi> ſignifies Treaties, Embaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies, by Marriages, and ſuch like, many differences may be compoſed.</p>
               <p>But in this year there happens a total Eclipſe of the <hi>Moon</hi> in the 16 degr. of <hi>Aquarius,</hi> that is in Sextil to the place of the Conjunction, but in Oppoſition to the place of <hi>Mars</hi> therein; <hi>Mars</hi> at the time of the Eclipſe is nigh to his place at the great Conjunction, and the <hi>M. C.</hi> thereof; is lately ſeparated or ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parating from a Quartile of <hi>Jupiter;</hi> both Planets are in Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal Signs, the one in his fall, the other in his detriment; theſe are of no ſmall moment, they prenote great detriment to ſome eminent perſons, ſome of the Clergy in thoſe parts called to queſtion, ſome Uproars and Commotions are to be feared.</p>
               <pb n="102" facs="tcp:41577:57"/>
               <p>The Eclipſe is viſible in <hi>England,</hi> and begins with us in the 11th. which ſignifies Favourites and Aſſiſtances of Kings and Princes; the Middle is the 10th. which ſignifies Emperours and Great Men in general; the End is in the 9th. which ſignifies Religion and the Religious, and ſhews the ſucceſſe of Voyages and Adventures by Sea.</p>
               <p>And that which is very obſervable is, that <hi>Mars</hi> after his ſeparation from the Square of <hi>Jupiter,</hi> comes next to the Sextile of <hi>Saturn,</hi> who diſpoſeth of the place eclipſed, and is poſited very neer to the place of the <hi>Sun</hi> in the great Conjunction; ſo that the effects of this Eclipſe will in a great meaſure put forward the influences of thoſe preceding Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gurations, and that the events are of a ſuperlative nature, <hi>viz.</hi> do operate chiefly upon the moſt eminent perſons and matters then acting upon the Stage of the world.</p>
               <p>The Eclipſe happens upon the 27 of <hi>July,</hi> but the effects will moſt forcibly manifeſt themſelves towards the latter end of the year, or about the beginning of 1665.</p>
               <p>The places more eſpecially concerned are thoſe that lie more Southward and South-eaſt, and ſome that lie full Eaſt from <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Aquarius,</hi> in which the Eclipſe happens, ſignifies great <hi>Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taria, Amazonia, Sarmatia, Valachia, Muſcovia,</hi> the South of <hi>Swethland, Weſtphalia;</hi> of Cities, <hi>Hamborough, Breme, Trent, Ingolſtade.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Mars</hi> afflicts <hi>Libra, viz. Auſtria,</hi> with Fires and Commoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, if not Wars; ſo alſo <hi>Lisbon, Vienna</hi> in <hi>Auſtria, Frank ford, Antwerp, &amp;c.</hi> And if <hi>Capricorn</hi> be the Aſcendent of <hi>Oxford, Jupiter,</hi> who repreſents Scolars and Divines, and men of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Orders, is unfortunately poſited therein, and afflicted by the Quartile of <hi>Mars:</hi> God grant Unity and Peace among the Reverend Clergy, and deliver the City from Fire and Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtilence.</p>
               <p>Towards the latter end of this year alſo is that other Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction of <hi>Saturn</hi> and <hi>Mars,</hi> neer the place of <hi>Sol</hi> and <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> in the great Conjunction, which doth alſo manifeſt its ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects moſt effectually in the following year; yet it may be fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:41577:57"/> that there will be notorious Robberies and Murthers com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted in the latter end of that year 1664.</p>
               <p>This Conjunction operates moſt forcibly upon <hi>Spain, Dal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matia, Hungaria,</hi> &amp;c. in which Death or Depoſition is ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied to ſome eminent perſon therein ere the year 1665. be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pired.</p>

I find in my inquiry very nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble configurations or meetings of the Planets, which do abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly manifeſt the Conjunctional effects in thoſe years in moſt parts of the world: For firſt, the Sun from his place at the firſt appearance of the new-ſtar, comes to the place of the ſaid Star about the beginning of the year 1665. (if not the latter end of the preceding year) and then to the Conjunction of <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piter</hi> and <hi>Mars,</hi> the year following; <hi>Mars</hi> and <hi>Jupiter</hi> about the ſame time to the ſextile place of the ſame Star, and of their own Conjunction; <hi>Venus</hi> to the trine of <hi>Mars</hi> in the latter end of the year 1665, or beginning of ſixty ſix, and the Conjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the year 1603. to the trine of the Moon in Autumn of the year 1665. Theſe I ſay are very notable, and do undoub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tedly about thoſe times produce moſt glorious actions in ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral parts of the world: Some eminent perſon comes to greater dignity and renown; thoſe matters ſignified more eſpecially by the new-ſtar, do now moſt apparently ſhew themſelves both in matters of Church and State. Some treaties of peace or reconciliations may be conjectured by Inter-marriages, ſignified by the trine of <hi>Mars</hi> and <hi>Venus,</hi> and ſome notable conſpiracy of the turbulent or ſeditious multitude diſcovered and appeaſed; <hi>Mercury</hi> in this year and about the middle thereof comes alſo to the Sextile of the Conjunction, in the ſecond of that Figure and in <hi>Aquarius</hi> where he hath dignity, ſo that from hence the Merchant may expect good returns by his adventures, eſpecially ſuch as deal into the Eaſtern and South eaſt parts of the world, nor will ſuch as adventure into the ſouth-weſt have cauſe to complain of their ill ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe.</p>
               <p>But we are alſo to obſerve that there is a partile Eclipſe of the Moon, <hi>Jan.</hi> 20. 1664/3. in the 12 degree of <hi>Leo,</hi> the aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent

            <p>I Have now done this diſcourſe, and in what is moſt obſervable therein, have faithfully (according to my ability) communicated to the world. As to thoſe more particular accidents that might have been diſcovered, (though of leſs concernment) the times thereof muſt be known from the revolutions and other configurations that have any ſimilitude to theſe more Eminent preceding cauſes; conſideration be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing had whether thoſe Concordances be from the Figure of Heaven, which do only ſhew the Accidents of particular places or perſons, or among the Planets themſelves, which indeed are more univerſal in their operations.</p>
            <p>I have omitted all the Conjunctions of the Inferiour planets, and indeed of the ſuperiours where they have not ſome concomitancy with our preſent ſubject, as of little concernment therewith; And of all the Eclipſes ſince the year 1672. becauſe of the uncertainty thereof from <hi>Argoll's Ephemerides,</hi> and the great errors frequently committed in that particular; all which are left (for thoſe years) to the more diligent inquiry of thoſe judicious Artiſts; that in their Annual Prognoſtiques ſhall have occaſion to make uſe thereof.</p>
            <p>There are ſome notable configurations as to the affairs of <hi>England,</hi> to be deduced from this Conjunction, which are purpoſely omitted, as having no ſufficient warrant to meddle withall, which with ſome other reaſons may be ſufficient excuſe for my publick Omiſsion; yet that I may not be thought too negligent, know that the years 1666. towards the latter end, and 1667, 68, 72, 74, and 75. do produce very notable Tranſactions as to the affairs of the Kingdom, but in what nature I forbear; I ſay thoſe years do moſt effectually ſhew the Conjunctional Influences amongſt us, ſeeing that generally it intends more the affairs of other Nations, eſpecially <hi>Spain, Italy, France,</hi> and <hi>Hungary</hi> onely: As to what may be Phyſically obſerved, I have in ſeveral places hinted, and have great cauſe to fear, do therefore once again premoniſh you of a great <hi>Plague</hi> in the year 1665. and pray <hi>God</hi> divert it.</p>

            <p>It is poſsible there may be ſome accidents happen that I have not mentioned, which ſome more curious inquiry may afterwards diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover, or perhaps by my own further experience, I may afterwards come to the knowledge of; For according to that of <hi>Manilius, lib. 1.

            <p>We are now arrived to the year 1682. in which happens another Conjunction of <hi>Saturn</hi> and <hi>Jupiter, October</hi> the 20. in the 20 de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of that Regal ſign <hi>Leo;</hi> There being in the preceding moneth of <hi>Septem.</hi> firſt a Conjunction of <hi>Jupiter</hi> and <hi>Mars,</hi> and then of <hi>Saturn</hi> and <hi>Mars</hi> in the ſame ſign; And (which is very notable, becauſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſual) theſe two ſuperior Planets do make two more Conjunctions in the ſame ſign, the one on the 20. of <hi>Jan.</hi> following in the 18. degree of <hi>Leo;</hi> the other the 16 of <hi>May</hi> in the 16 of the ſame.
